But they stalked the two with a smile, and once their presence is acknowledged, they slinked back into the darkness like they belonged there.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

Apparently the ninja was also from the sound as his headband rested on his neck. A sound symbol planted cleanly in the middle of it.

<font color=#198aad>&#34; I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve met you before. I&#39;m Shenza. &#34;</font> Shenza&#39;s red hair blew in the breeze as he sat down beside the ninja. He was quite bored... <font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

I meeded some where to train these eyes, causin&#39; alot of problems though.&#34;</font> With the burning of his eyes, it was getting strained every minute, he thought to himself <font color=#666699>&#34;How did the elders do it? This shit is a pain.&#34;</font> Placing his hands in his pocket, the boy began to whistle.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 23:08> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#1bc8b0>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>wasn&#39;t sure what they meant, but based on the fact that there was her and another Uchiha right beside herself, he must be talking about the Sharingan? her&#39;s wasn&#39;t out, but Kato&#39;s was apparently.

She doesn&#39;t respond to him for a good 10 seconds, seeming to stall to see if he was talking to someone else, before looking down and accepting that it was directed to her. <font color=#1bc8b0>&#34;I&#39;m Shina...Uchiha.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 23:10> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ec4ffe>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>stopped as he approached the group of people that were in the viscinity of the area, looking between the three of them to see who he had already known or met. He gave a slight wave to Shenza before turning towards the other two.

<font color=#ec4ffe>&#34;Sup Shenza. Trying to make more friends? I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve met either of these two before.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

Must be nice to be gifted huh. <font color=#198aad>&#34; They say it gets easier over time, but then again I wouldn&#39;t know. &#34;</font> He returns his gaze to the Kunoichi that he was talking to earlier. <font color=#198aad>&#34; Nice to meet you Shina. &#34;</font> He sits down on the gravel beside the Kunoichi as he closes his eyes for a second. Letting a deep breath out he takes in the warm air of the Sound Village. &lt; Peace at last... &gt; He reopens his eyes and sees that two other ninja have appeared. One of which he knew, the other.... not so much.

<font color=#198aad>&#34; Hey Jahin. &#34;</font> He looks over towards the other Kunoichi. and nods towards her.

<big><07/11/2019 23:24> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>began to whistle louder as he grew bored, with the annoyance from the eyes bothering him, he pulled out his Genjutsu book. Skipping through a couple of pages, he looked for an genjutsu that could fool everyone and he can walk away easy. Finding something that was close to it, he began reading on it, zoning out everyone. IF they wanted to say something to him. They would have to tap him to get his attention.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 23:26> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#cc0066>Haruno, Hikari <font color=yellow>Hikari had been practicing her suiton nearby and was just done. So much frustration at the lack of progress on her jutsus. SO MUCH. Her eyebrow was twitching slightly, but she offers a nod to the gathered Shinobi, smiling a  bit. 

<font color=#cc0066>&#34;Hello.&#34;</font> <font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 23:26> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#1bc8b0>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>rests her head in her hands, keeping her eyes to herself, not wanting to look at any of the people she didn&#39;t know, and even then, she hardly knew a thing about Kato personally, even if they were in the same clan.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
