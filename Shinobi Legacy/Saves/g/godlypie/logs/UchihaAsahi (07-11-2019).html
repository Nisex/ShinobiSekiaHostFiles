Raising a brow at the pupils, it wasn&#39;t something that you see in the average ninja. Opening the book he showed him the pictures and words that was coming out of the book. But, he placed the book back down. To rub his eyes, his eyes were getting strained by the minute.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 11:09> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Uchiha, Asahi <font color=yellow>walked up towards the two whom were seated in the central area of the village, and decided to join them as he had almost nothing better to do. He leaned against the wall and folded his arms after giving a short wave to one of his fellow clansmen.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 11:12> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow><font color=#198aad>&#34; Genjustu huh... I&#39;ve never been good at it. &#34;</font> He seemed to be actively reading the book before the ninja put the book down to rub his eyes. <font color=#198aad>&#34; Does that hurt? &#34;</font> He could hear footsteps approaching from behind them and he turned around. Another sound ninja, eveident from the headband. He waved at them as he rested his back on the wall. Shenza nods, greeting the ninja before looking back at the ninja holding the book. <font color=#198aad>&#34; I&#39;m Shenza. &#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 11:18> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow><font color=#666699>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t say hurt. . Just burns a lot.&#34;</font> He moved his hands off of his eyes, to see his surroundings again. He looked at the new Ninja that came, waving at him. The crimson eyes went back to it&#39;s dull color. Picking up his book <font color=#666699>&#34;I&#39;m Kato, from the Uchiha Clan.&#34;</font> He opened the book to see where they left off. Skipping through pages, he found the page. <font color=#666699>&#34;With enough reading, you&#39;ll be good at it.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 11:24> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Uchiha, Asahi <font color=yellow>slightly lowers his eyes as he continued to examine the Uchiha. Seems he already unlocked his Sharingan. That in itself seperated him from most of the clansmen, for only a few are even capable of using it, let alone at a young age. He surely had potential within him.

As the Shinobi started to introduce themselves, Asahi began to raise his upper body off from the wall, and took a seat next to Shemzu. The two seemed to be pretty alright, which eased his mind a bit more to actively converse with them.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Pardon me, Shenza right?&#34;</font>, the young lad said,shuffling the to left corner of the bench to give Shenza some space.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I&#39;m Asahi, also a member of the uchiha clan. Pleasure to meet both of you.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

Gifted at birth. &#34;</font> Shenza lets out a small laugh as he continues reading, admiring the pictures. It seems that the most Genjustu that he&#39;d ever be able to perform was something like the Darkness technique. <font color=#198aad>&#34; Maybe I&#39;ll pick that up sometime.... &#34;</font> he mutters.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 11:42> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>wasn&#39;t his first time reading this book, he had to look at some of these Genjutsu, since some seemed cool to him. There was circles on the picture to show that he wanted to learn the Genjutsu <font color=#666699>&#34;Well, elaborate more on &#39;gifted at birth&#39;. Most of us train alot at  a young age.&#34;</font> He adjusted his headband. <font color=#666699>&#34;Asahi, are you going to learn Genjutsu, when you have the time?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/11/2019 11:46> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Uchiha, Asahi <font color=yellow>shrugged, as he pivoted his head slightly ro the right and looked at Kato from his peripherals.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I&#39;m studying how to do it, but don&#39;t have any actual jutsu yet.&#34;</font>, he said as a means to answer the fellow Uchiha&#39;s question.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;and I disagree with you on hat, Shenzu. You could be born unto the best bloodline but without any actual skill or practice you wont really amount to anything.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

Shenza decides to stand up and stretch, letting out a deep breath. How refreshing.. He cracks his knuckles before asking the ninja a question. <font color=#198aad>&#34; Anyone up for a spar? I was training before I got here, so why not. &#34;</font>

His red eyes bounce between the two ninja, wondering if they&#39;d accept his request. A small breeze passes by the ninja, lifting his robes up a little, dark eight legged insects seemed to be crawling within the robes. Eventually the breeze passes by allowing his robes to rest, securing the insects. <font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

He was going to return home and probably nap. <font color=#666699>&#34;Have fun sparring.&#34;</font> Now walking off to his house.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

Asahi wiped some of the sweat off his face, then continued to punch the log as he spoke.

<big><07/11/2019 21:29> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Uchiha, Asahi <font color=yellow>walked down the stairs, his hands resided within the depths of his pockets as he continued to look for Kato. He searched the village high and low to no avail. He was begnning to seriously worry that the person who oozed danger might have kidnapped him. He hoped that wasn&#39;t the case.

However, as he began to descend the final flight of stairs, it was much worse than he could have ever anticipated. 

Whilst The Elder and Asahi was worrying, here he was at the outskirts of the village, seemingly getting his neck licked.

Asahi stopped in his tracks, as a dark shadow looked over his upper face, making his eyes barely visible. He took his right hand out of his pocket, and rubbed his hand with a rather loud sigh that might have cought both of there attention.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I didn&#39;t think you were that type of guy, Kato. Guess I judged you too early.&#34;</font>, the young lad began to say as he turned his back to his clansmen. 

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Sorry for interupting. Just wanted to make sure you were ok.&#34;</font>, Asahi said, as he lowered his hand from his face and formed a fist as his body trembled.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;By the way, this may have been what you were studying for...But I hear Genjutsu makes this kind of thing more enjoyable for some!&#34;</font>, he said as he dashed back to the village. he was mroe dramatic than he needed to be, but giving Kato a little scare wouldn&#39;t hurt.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

Stay away from them.&#34;</font> He began touching the grass, to make sure that he was done having the siliva on his hands gone. Kato&#39;s body shivered once more as he continued to keep his distance from the Shinobi.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

His eyes were still Blood red and Shenza could tell by his face that it was still putting a strain on him. As he approached Kato he smiled and said: <font color=#198aad>&#34; Don&#39;t kill yourself. &#34;</font> <font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

He gave a light smile and a little wave before leaning against the bench with his left arm seeing as how the other seat was already taken.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;My bad about yesterday. I was joking but it seemed that it got to you more than I expected.&#34;</font>, the lad said while scratching the side of his face. He noticed that Shenza was also herre ahd offered a wave to him aswell.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;So, what are you up to Kato? I figured, if you&#39;re not busy maybe we can do a little training together.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

We can train later, after I finish this chapter.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 10:59> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Shenza <font color=yellow>gave Asahi a light wave as he looked towards Kota as he planned to make another joke about it. He then noticed that they had a visitor and he whispers to Kota: <font color=#198aad>&#34; Isn&#39;t that, that same guy from before.... &#34;</font> He thinks to himself, &lt; Who even is this guy &gt;. Shenza decides not to confront him just yet but he is on guard now. <font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 11:03> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Uchiha, Asahi <font color=yellow>gave a small nod, before starting to practice handseals for a new jutsu he had learned from an Elder clansmen. 

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;So, how&#39;s your Genjutsu looking Kato? I&#39;ve been working on it myself, along with a few Ninjutsu here and there.&#34;</font>, he asked inquisitively.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 11:20> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Uchiha, Kato <font color=yellow>held out his book, pointing at the illustration. It showed a blizzard happening, surrounding a person. <font color=#666699>&#34;I&#39;m focusin&#39; on this, might be something. I&#39;ll need in the future. What have you been workin&#39; on?&#34;</font> The crimson eyes peeled off of the book and laid upon Asahi.

<font color=#666699>&#34;With enough practice, I can do it.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 11:24> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#9966ff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>does not move from their spot and makes little to no sound. Their eyes widen the more they observed Kato and the book he&#39;s reading before moving their attention to Asahi and Shenza.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 11:29> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Uchiha, Asahi <font color=yellow>peers over towards Shenza. He appeared to be on guard, most likely due to the strange ninja&#39;s appearence. Asahi had been aware of their presense, for he had felt another Chakra signature approach when his Sharingan was active, but chose to ignore them seeing as how they weren&#39;t doing anything and talking about them would make Kato uncomfortable, which would have been pretty funny to see actually.

He focused most of his attention back to Kato, and resumed to speak.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Ah, I know that one. It&#39;s really useful, glad you&#39;re picking it up.&#34;</font>, Asahi began to say. <font color=#71a6bd>&#34;And I&#39;ve been working on my Ninjutsu and Weapon skills recently. I finished my Taijutsu training yesterday. I&#39;m not the strongest of Shinobi but it&#39;d be good to have that kind of experience under my belt.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

I haven&#39;t trained my Taijutsu yet, but I&#39;ll do it when I have the time.&#34;</font> He squinted his eyes at both of them, there was something funny. Shenza was on guard but for what? Lowering his book there was two Chakra&#39;s that he was seeing. Placing his head in the book. The boy seemed like he saw a ghost, he didn&#39;t want no trouble at the moment. Since he was learning.

<font color=#666699>&#34;Psst. . Let&#39;s go.&#34;</font> He whispered.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 11:40> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ec4ffe>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>gave a short wave towards the group of people near the bench as he walked up to it, crossing his arms while standing close to the bench itself as he spoke up.

<font color=#ec4ffe>&#34;Sup Shenza and...Guy that was licked. I don&#39;t think I actually got your name when we met the last time.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

He was glad that Jahin had arrived to reduce a little bit of tension. <font color=#198aad>&#34; Hey Jahin. The whole group is here once again huh? &#34;</font> 

<font color=#198aad>&#34; Anyways, Asahi. You said something about training right? Got anywhere in mind? &#34;</font> He nods at Kato, letting him know that he heard him.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 11:47> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc00050d]><font color=#ec4ffe>Sound Ninja says, "Whole group? I guess we have been seeing each other around a lot."</font></font><br></big>

<font color=#9966ff>&#34;Next time, Kato Uchiha.&#34;</font> They whispered as they take their leave.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 11:51> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Uchiha, Asahi <font color=yellow>lowered his eyes and gave a light smile towards Kato. He seemed pretty shakin up about this person. Perhaps leaving him with them was the wrong call, but there was more enough people there to watch his back. Besides, he couldn&#39;t exactly say no after he was branded &#39;the guy who was licked&#39; because of him.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Alright.&#34;</font>, he started to whisper back <font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Where would you like to go?&#34;</font>, he asked as he gave a small wave towards the the other Wild haired Shinobi who appraoached.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

Maybe to another bench spot?&#34;</font> He whispered back, as he closed to book, with his facial expression slowly returning to normal. He saw the rock shinobi was leaving. Kato whispered again <font color=#666699>&#34;Actually, they are leavin&#39; so we can stay, here.&#34;</font> He laid the book out infront of him.

<font color=#666699>&#34;We should play a game.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

I&#39;m Uchiha, Kato. Pleasure to meet you.&#34;</font> He held out his hand for a formal greet.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

Seems like Shenza and that other shonobi went their seperate ways. Now it was just kato, some fellow he hadn&#39;t seen before, and....some weird guy dressed in strange clothing?

Asahi found him to be oddbut there was bound to be a few weird individuals within the big world they inhabited. Thus, he shrugged it off, and walked towards the wall behind Kato and proceeded to lean on it.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Still reading?&#34;</font>, he asked with a light smile before waving towards the Other Sound Ninja.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

The Namikaze let out a refreshing &#39;ahh&#39; and laid back on the bench.

<font color=#94ad8c>&#34;So Kato-san? Cool.&#34;</font>He said casually whilst giving him a firm handshake.With that out of the way, he turned his focus towards the other shinobi leaning against the wall <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;I was wondering when you&#39;d stop staring out into space like that.&#34;</font>He chuckled.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

His emperor had built them, but it seemed everybody did forget of his deeds. All that they could remember today? Slander of usurpers, unrighteous inheritors to the throne of a being beyond mankind.

The schwarzmantel stepped into another enemy domain. Otogakure, the land of plains. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;So close to home, yet so far from the truth,&#34;</font> the soldier said. It seemed he missed one arm, a scar from battle?<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

Calming himself down, he focused on the guy and noticed several things about him.The first thing he noticed was obviously the big kite-like thing he was wearing, but the most eye-catching was his missing arm...

<font color=#94ad8c>&#34;So.....Stranger-san......where do you hail from then?&#34;</font>He asked<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

As Asahi continued to gaze and assess him, he noticed that one of the sleeves was just dangling and seemed to move with the breeze. was he missing an arm? or is it just within his clothing. Whatever the case, what he said was weird. What did he mean by &#39;so far from the truth&#39;? This thought lingered inside inside Asahi&#39;s mind like a never ending carousel.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;The Sound is your home?&#34;</font>, the lad inquired. <font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I haven&#39;t seen you around here before. Parhaps you&#39;re a shinobi returning from duty?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

Then, he traced his steps back to stand before the strangers. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Weimantel,&#34;</font> he admitted. The ancient order was but a mere conspiracy, removed repeatedly from historical records.

But, that&#39;d explain his strange fashion sense, for the ancient order wore intricate robes of ivory and silver.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:29> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Namikaze, Zoku <font color=yellow>rose up from his laid-back position, his elbows on his knees as he placed his face onto his hands, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Weelmantel? Sounds ancient....&#34;</font>He told him.The young Namikaze sighed as he watched the one-armed man just stand there.

Zoku smiled as he patted the seat next to him, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Well now im interested! Come sit and tell us about WEELMANTEL!&#34;</font>He told him.It wasnt that he was nosy or anything, its just......was there anything better to do right now?<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:31> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Uchiha, Asahi <font color=yellow>squinted, as the Stranger answered the fellow Sound Ninja&#39;s question. Weimantel? What was that. Asahi had never heard such a weird sounding phrase before. The mention of that phrase made the young lad suspicious, but yet, at the same time, he was intrigued. Could this Weimantel thing be related to the truth he was talking about?

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I&#39;m sorry?&#34;</font>, Asahi said as he rose his body from up again the wall, and walked around the bench to get a better view of the Stranger. <font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve never heard of such a town or nation. What might that be?&#34;</font> he inquired.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:35> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0x0]><font color=#198aad>Shenza says, "Am I intruding?"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:36> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>reached for the bench. Each step, carried a heave of destruction, plummeting the concrete beneath the black sandals. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Weimantel is the ancient order constructed by the early emperor&#39;s advisor. Kanar created an orphanage and trained them into soldiers that kept the order,&#34;</font> he revealed as he stepped forth to the bench.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;Naturally, governments began to hunt us,&#34;</font> he continued on. It then became clear that this teenage soldier could also be an enemy to the government of this here domain, but that did not seem to bother the veteran child. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;It is a saddening fact that even you did not hear of the Weimantel that stopped the second world war.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:42> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Uchiha, Kato <font color=yellow>raised a brow at the unknown Shinobi, he zoned out what he was saying before. Being lost, he closed his book to see what did this person want. Closing the book, the crimson eyes turned into a dull red color. Clearing his throat.

<font color=#666699>&#34;Did you want something?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:43> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Namikaze, Zoku <font color=yellow>could see the damage this unknown shinobi was causing to the street, but what was he supposed to do about it? At first he took it as a sign of hostility, but soon displaced that theory when the weelmantel shinobi began to tell his story.

Zoku grimaced, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Hmm....Well I wont say that I believe you in that regards as I&#39;ve NEVER heard of your organization at all.....especially when if they were that important in the war, how could NO one know about them?&#34;</font>He stated plainly<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:46> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Uchiha, Asahi <font color=yellow>| | The Uchiha&#39;s eyes widens, as he proceeded to leap back to a comfortable distance in response to not only the stranger&#39;s advancement or the very pavement giving in to the overwhelming pressure he was exerting, but rather the mention of Weimantel being related to the term &#39;Emperor&#39;. Though the world has known a brief time of peace and the newer generation had been sheltered from the past atrocities that were comitted during the war, stories and rumors have been spread down as time continued to pass, so Asahi knew that this Stranger was more or less dangerous, if not highly suspicious.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Why would someone in a group that was formed by the emperor&#39;s deceased advisor be here now of all times and places?&#34;</font>, Asahi asked as sweat rolled down the side of his face.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:51> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#d42780>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>flicked a lighter, letting the calm flames graze his cigarette. He would clip the lighter, closing it and depositing it back into his pockets. An index and middle finger would lace the outer material, giving way for smoke to exit from the tubular shape. 

Slowly, the same fingers would bring the cigarette down a little, so he could exhale. Seemed a scene had been boiling for what could have been some time. There were familiar clothes, but not familiar faces. Nevertheless, His take on the situation was as any comparable to his younger days. The cigaratte would take itself back to his lips, puffing again.

<font color=#d42780>&#34;Seems like I&#39;m late to the party. Whats wrong?&#34;</font> His pupils locked onto the most interesting figure, and as a response, they dilated. His fingers widened, the thin shaped cylinder dropping to the floor.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:13> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>chuckled at the ignorance, but he couldn&#39;t blame anyone. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Your government has lied to you,&#34;</font> he said, in pain and in grace, he rose his hand to the cosmos and made a fist. Blossoms did release from trees, like blood from the veins. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Schwarzmantel of the Weimantel. I do not belong in any domain, even though the emperor constructed them,&#34;</font> the messenger said.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;My duty as the blackcloak is simple, freund. I simply deliver the truth and sacrifice all that is necessary. I, a mere orphan, was accepted and taught as if family. That is the least I could do.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:20> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Namikaze, Zoku <font color=yellow>placed his face back onto his hands and let out a whistling noise, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;So basically....You&#39;re like a a remainant soldier from this organization named Welmantel and my government-well the current government has tracked you all down and is trying to demolish any information about you guys and your deeds?&#34;</font>He stated as a recap to what he was saying.

The reason he did so, was to help him process it all.It wasnt as though what he was saying was complicated or shocking, but it just didn&#39;t make sense to him.Why would the government want to discredit those that helped stop a war? 

Although that was a valid question, Zoku, wasn&#39;t the type to address something unless he felt absolutely necessary.So he decided to just nod and watch the unknown shinobi&#39;s mannerism...This guy was just too suspicious!<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:22> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc0004d1]><font color=#71a6bd>Uchiha, Asahi says, "9skip me for this round"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:23> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Uchiha, Kato <font color=yellow>still stood there, on the bench, placing his book in his pouch. He rised up off of the bench, Kato placed his hand on his chin. Absorbing all of the information that this &#39;shinobi&#39; was giving him, he had some questions for the shinobi.

<font color=#666699>&#34;So. . What did the &#39;government&#39; lie about?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:24> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0x0]><font color=#d4586b>Sound Ninja says, "WTF IS THIS BUG"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:31> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>stepped forth as the mantle danced upon the breeze. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Silence, that is the sound of your government,&#34;</font> he said as he pointed at the soldiers. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Isan delivered the end to his opponents, but for some odd reason, the sons and daughters of these leaders began to lead once more. The council hid information, solely to besmirch the emperor once more.&#34;</font>

A sigh rose from one&#39;s lips, <font color=#ffffff>&#34;there is soon to be a conflict once more. Weimantel sent me to find those responsible, to spread the message and to inform as many as possible. Weimantel was formed as an order to stop innocent bloodshed, but this road once more leads to just that.&#34;</font>

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;A third world war where many sacrifices will have to be made..&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:39> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Namikaze, Zoku <font color=yellow>was taken aback as watched the unknown shinobi.The way the man was speaking was if his organization was going to cause a third war? Zoku grimaced, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;I can understand-no I cant understand what your organizations has been through, but from what you&#39;re saying.....It sounds like you guys want a war? I aint down with that.&#34;</font>He announced.

<font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Im not for the government or against it...I am a shinobi, so i just follow orders, but id never be for something that wants war...ever,so I hope you aren&#39;t trying to  do this...&#34;</font>Zoku would then pull out a kunai.

What was this rookie shino<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:39> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Namikaze, Zoku <font color=yellow>//what was this rookie shinobi going to do with it?<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:41> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Uchiha, Asahi <font color=yellow>lowers his eyelid, as he motions towards the back of his hit, and placed his hand on top of his Kunai holster just encase the worse case situation were to happen.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;The past is the past. All we can do is to look at what our previous mistakes have done to the Shinodi world without dwelling on it, for that wouldn&#39;t help us in todat&#39;s present.&#34;</font>, Asahi began to say.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;There is bound to be conflict once more, but unlike what happened in the war years ago I will ensure that the Sound be prepared for it, so no sacrifices are casualties are to happen. I don&#39;t know if what you&#39;re saying about the Government is true or not, nor do i have the means to verify it. However, if that&#39;s what it takes to bring about a longer time of peace, then I wouldn&#39;t mind those who they govern to remain ignorant to the truth.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:46> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Shenza <font color=yellow>would listen in as he propped his foot up on the wall.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:51> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>grinned in delight &#39;fore he held open his hand. Then, a hundred spiders began to climb from the gap of the grin. Each spider had a name, each an individual, prepared to give in their flame for the truth. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;We do not desire bloodshed, ,&#34;</font> the blackcloak stated &#39;fore he placed a finger underneath his eyelid.

Then, a crimson spider began to climb from the slit. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Shin,&#34;</font> he called the spider, once he looked on at the soldiers of the enemy domain. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;We were put here on this earth to feel nothing but pain,&#34;</font> he said to the spider.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;I&#39;ve seen many ignore the truth solely to protect their circle, but, the truth cannot be forgotten. The web we weaved in the past shall catch those flies that spread their lies. Do you know what spiders have in common with humans?&#34;</font> He questioned those before him.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;They devour each other.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:51> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Namikaze, Zoku <font color=yellow>pulled out an apple and begins to peel the skin with the kunai, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Not that I can do anything about right now.&#34;</font>He said.The young Namikaze would then began to whistle as he dwindled away the foreskin of the apple.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:54> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Uchiha, Kato <font color=yellow>grew bored, this didn&#39;t interest him at all. Placing his hands in his pocket, he was going to train somewhere and do something productive. Sitting here and listening to this wasn&#39;t really something productive to him. Waving at the people that he knew, Kato began to walk off.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

When he heard, that the strange man just challenged them to a battle in order to see if they are prepared for battle, he approached the group and stopped next to the bench.

The young genin really hated the word <font color=#c161bd>&#34;war&#34;</font>, since it took his entire family from him, and he really hoped that it&#39;s possible to avoid another one....Sadly it was highely unlikely, so the best move would be accepting the challenge, and finding out about his combat capabilities before it&#39;s too late.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/12/2019 15:26> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>sighed in the most exaggerated manner possible. The spiders began to flood over the ground, as they seemed to talk to their father. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;We&#39;ve fought many times before in our previous lives. Araneus fought here, too. Toga did fight here, against the infamous usurper emperor; Tozuki Iwazuka..&#34;</font>

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;I, Kumojin, Adateus shall take their mantle of sacrifice. My intention is not bloodshed, but true peace under the return of the emperor. If you desire, you can join me and find out the truth for yourself, or you can keep being fooled by your government, used as livestock to keep their power afloat.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/12/2019 15:33> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#9966ff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>returned to their favorite spot in the village and watched a sermon from a man who has an audience of spiders as well as Otogakure natives. There was disinterest in their demeanor to the whole speech.

In fact, Stitch settles for reclining on the rooftop of the wall, awaiting for at least Kato&#39;s opinion on it.

<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:35> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Uchiha, Asahi <font color=yellow>squints, as a horde of spiders were summoned forth from the Strange Man. he leaps back, and draws out a Kunai. Even though he was supposedly &#39;testing&#39; them, perhaps this may have been too much for a bunch of genin to fight off.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I don&#39;t mind if the Government continues to deceive the people they have governed, for it has continuously brought us peace, and for once a time of prosperity. Engaging in conflict with the Emperor once more would only serve to reenact the past atrocities commited, for the Emperor himself was also willing to make sacrifices, no matter what it may have been. And look where that got him. For those reasons, I&#39;ll have to decline your offer, as much as a fool it would make me.&#34;</font>, the lad concluded, as he placed a firm grip on his Kunai.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Those are just my feelings, however. I am unable to speak for anyone else.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/12/2019 15:37> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Uchiha, Kato <font color=yellow>looked at the spiders , they were growing in numbers. All he wanted to do is train, but he was stopped by these spiders and Shinobi. He didn&#39;t care for the speech or anything, it was pointless to him. He thought it was just a person trying to convince him for something stupid. Kato reached down to his kunai holster, thinking this can be some time of training for him.

<font color=#666699>&#34;Look, listen, I don&#39;t care for this.&#34;</font> His set his target on the spiders other then the Man who created them.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:48> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>observed the fools that desired to be fooled. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Indeed, &#39;tis as history said,&#34;</font> the lord of arachnae spoke. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;There is no one interested in justice, justice is a long gone concept,&#34;</font> he announced. The spiders kept climbing from his mouth gap, until the entire street seemed to be covered in ivory constructs of silk.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;One side brings shadow, the other brings light. But in the rushing tide, every human is the same; a stain. They shall inevitably choose for disorder, instead of order. You and your friends are proof of this disorder, a desire to be deceived by those that have committed atrocities, murdered families, ended heroes, destroyed competitors,&#34;</font> the ivory man stated.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;Enough talking. Let us begin this trial, bastard humans, children of the usurper,&#34;</font> he declared &#39;fore his armor plate fell into the ground. The ivory cloak floated in the air as silk wrapped around the entire area, constructing a colosseum of woven webs. Then, he held up his singular arm, screaming into the aether.

The scream ruptured ear drums, as the pale skin of the teenage soldier turned crimson. Pupils turned silver, veins began to bulge.. and then he rushed to chop the throat of his opponents at once as if an executioner.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:57> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Uchiha, Asahi <font color=yellow>narrowed his gaze upon the Strange Man and his spider companions. Seems like talking was no longer an option, as he was preparing to get things underway. Truthfully, when he said he wanted to &#39;test&#39; the group of genin, Asahi thought that fighting group of people, kids as they may be, would put them at a disadvantage, however, he immediately eliminated that and it were not the Sound ninja who should be weary.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;So be it.&#34;</font>, asahi said, as his eyes shifted into a Crimson hue, one tomoe visible within them. He looked around at the surrounding area, and at the Spiders. It seems each and every one of them were embedded with Chakra, so dealing with them as well as him would be tricky. None the less, Asahi braced himself for what was to come. He was determined to prove to him that the Sound was better off without the truth that he spoke of.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:58> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Shenza <font color=yellow>Jumps back in response to the &#39; Ivory Mans &#39; assault, <font color=#198aad>&#34; You do realize.. Regardless of which path we take. War or fighting is inevitable, only thing that changes is the opponent. Either way, I can&#39;t just stand here and let this go on, nothin personal. &#34;</font> 

Shenza puts up the tiger handseal while he puts distance between himself and the spiders. Surely, nothing good was going to come of this. If things keep on going this way someone would get hurt. Kill or be killed huh?<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

The boy was confident in killing spiders, they were no different then a Deer or a wild animal in the forest, preparing himself for this &#39;battle&#39; this would be some training for him. With the grip tightened on the kunai, he moved his right hand with haste to collect some shruikens. With his hands now prepared for this.

His adrenaline rush kicked in. With his body tensing up, he was now ready to fight these spiders. Not knowing what this man had in his sleeves.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 16:01> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#c161bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>performs a quick warm-up exercise prior to the battle and assumes the combat dance stance of the Larch, preparing for it.

His first move would be an attempt to kill all the spiders in a single motion. Afterwards, he would join the rest in an attempt to defeat the stranger. The young Kaguya would utilize the Larch dance for the most part of the battle, but there&#39;s a chance that he would use the Camellia dance if the fight was too easy, or chakra scalpels if he was pushed to his limits. He wasn&#39;t exactly fond of fighting, so he would try his best to bring an end to the conflict as soon as possible.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
