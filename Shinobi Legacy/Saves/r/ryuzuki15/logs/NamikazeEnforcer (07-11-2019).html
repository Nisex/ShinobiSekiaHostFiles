<big><07/12/2019 05:26> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#c161bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>was too tired to keep going, so he called it a day. The young shinobi tried to forget about these bad memories, but they kept coming back..He sat down on a bench and succumbed to the dark emotions. He closed his eyes and started seeing flashbacks of that day....


It was October the 10th of year 137, it was a rainy day. Akkuni was 9 years old, he was living with his grandparents, they adopted him after his parents died in the last year of the war, when he was only two. He didn&#39;t really remember them, he was too young.

 The child was returning from a ramen restaurant with his grandpa and grandma in the evening, it was raining heavily. The streets were empty. While walking next to an alley, they heard screaming for help. They decided to take a look, and told Akkuni to stay behind. He didn&#39;t listen, decided to get closer, and watched while hiding behind a garbage container.

He saw a group of middle aged shinobi beating up a teenager, some of them had kunai in their hands. Akkuni&#39;s grandpa asked what&#39;s going on, and told them to leave him alone. The group of ninja turned around, and one of them explained the situation to the old man. They were &#39;teaching him a lesson&#39; for refusing to rob a traveller from the hidden leaf. They still held a grudge to the other villages, even though the war ended. One of the shinobi finished off the teenager, which was a step too far to his grandpa. 

He prepared for combat by assuming the <font color=#c161bd>&#34;Dance of the Larch&#34;</font>, a technique giving almost absolute defense against taijutsu, and the ability to fight multiple opponents at once.

The old man was spinning around and killing the bandits with ease, that was until a kunai with an explosive tag was thrown from behind the back of Akkuni out of nowhere. The tag was detonated right in front of Akkuni&#39;s grandpa, which killed him instantly. His grandma was watching from behind, so she was just knocked unconscious, but...she was still finished off by one of them afterwards. 

When Akkuni realized what happened, he decided to turn around.
Behind him stood a few more thugs, who came to their friends&#39; rescue. One of them grabbed Akkuni&#39;s hair and started punching him in the face. Afterwards he threw him into the wall, and let the rest finish the job. They started kicking him, punching him, spitting on him, and eventually stabbed him with a kunai.

Shortly after they got bored and ran away from the scene, someone spotted him, picked him up from the ground and transported to the hospital. Normally, he would be dead, but his instincts made him create a layer of bone underneath his skin, which saved him from fatal injuries. A few days later, Akkuni was discharged from the hospital, but the problem was, he had nowhere to go.

Since that day, he spent as much time as possible in the hospital, because it was the only place where people cared about others, the only place where he felt safe. One of the nurses brought him food every day, and taught him the basics of medical jutsu. The child developed an interest in the medical jutsu, and wanted to help other people, but at the same time, he despised the ninja world, and wanted to get rid of shinobi altogether. These two things conflicted with eachother, because almost every person in the world was a shinobi at this point, but he didn&#39;t want to see any more violence. He knew there was no way to get rid of them, the world was spoiled to it&#39;s roots, but he wanted to believe, that there is a way to stop the violence by spreading love and support.

This conflict made him develop two distinct personalities, who kept arguing with eachother inside of his head, and still do to this day.

<big><07/12/2019 14:13> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>chuckled at the ignorance, but he couldn&#39;t blame anyone. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Your government has lied to you,&#34;</font> he said, in pain and in grace, he rose his hand to the cosmos and made a fist. Blossoms did release from trees, like blood from the veins. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Schwarzmantel of the Weiﬂmantel. I do not belong in any domain, even though the emperor constructed them,&#34;</font> the messenger said.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;My duty as the blackcloak is simple, freund. I simply deliver the truth and sacrifice all that is necessary. I, a mere orphan, was accepted and taught as if family. That is the least I could do.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:20> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>placed his face back onto his hands and let out a whistling noise, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;So basically....You&#39;re like a a remainant soldier from this organization named Welmantel and my government-well the current government has tracked you all down and is trying to demolish any information about you guys and your deeds?&#34;</font>He stated as a recap to what he was saying.

The reason he did so, was to help him process it all.It wasnt as though what he was saying was complicated or shocking, but it just didn&#39;t make sense to him.Why would the government want to discredit those that helped stop a war? 

Although that was a valid question, Zoku, wasn&#39;t the type to address something unless he felt absolutely necessary.So he decided to just nod and watch the unknown shinobi&#39;s mannerism...This guy was just too suspicious!<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:22> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc0004d1]><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja says, "9skip me for this round"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:31> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>stepped forth as the mantle danced upon the breeze. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Silence, that is the sound of your government,&#34;</font> he said as he pointed at the soldiers. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Isan delivered the end to his opponents, but for some odd reason, the sons and daughters of these leaders began to lead once more. The council hid information, solely to besmirch the emperor once more.&#34;</font>

A sigh rose from one&#39;s lips, <font color=#ffffff>&#34;there is soon to be a conflict once more. Weiﬂmantel sent me to find those responsible, to spread the message and to inform as many as possible. Weiﬂmantel was formed as an order to stop innocent bloodshed, but this road once more leads to just that.&#34;</font>

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;A third world war where many sacrifices will have to be made..&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:19> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#c161bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>was just eavesdropping on the dialogue, up until now. When he heard, that the strange man just challenged them to a battle in order to see if they are prepared for battle, he approached the group and stopped next to the bench.

The young genin really hated the word <font color=#c161bd>&#34;war&#34;</font>, since it took his entire family from him, and he really hoped that it&#39;s possible to avoid another one....Sadly it was highely unlikely, so the best move would be accepting the challenge, and finding out about his combat capabilities before it&#39;s too late.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:20> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc000492]><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja says, "Fighting huh?"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:20> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc000492]><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja says, "For what?"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:26> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>sighed in the most exaggerated manner possible. The spiders began to flood over the ground, as they seemed to talk to their father. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;We&#39;ve fought many times before in our previous lives. Araneus fought here, too. Toga did fight here, against the infamous usurper emperor; Tozuki Iwazuka..&#34;</font>

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;I, Kumojin, Adateus shall take their mantle of sacrifice. My intention is not bloodshed, but true peace under the return of the emperor. If you desire, you can join me and find out the truth for yourself, or you can keep being fooled by your government, used as livestock to keep their power afloat.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:28> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc000492]><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja says, "Either way, still gonna be fighting."</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:33> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#9966ff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>returned to their favorite spot in the village and watched a sermon from a man who has an audience of spiders as well as Otogakure natives. There was disinterest in their demeanor to the whole speech.

In fact, Stitch settles for reclining on the rooftop of the wall, awaiting for at least Kato&#39;s opinion on it.

<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:35> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>squints, as a horde of spiders were summoned forth from the Strange Man. he leaps back, and draws out a Kunai. Even though he was supposedly &#39;testing&#39; them, perhaps this may have been too much for a bunch of genin to fight off.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I don&#39;t mind if the Government continues to deceive the people they have governed, for it has continuously brought us peace, and for once a time of prosperity. Engaging in conflict with the Emperor once more would only serve to reenact the past atrocities commited, for the Emperor himself was also willing to make sacrifices, no matter what it may have been. And look where that got him. For those reasons, I&#39;ll have to decline your offer, as much as a fool it would make me.&#34;</font>, the lad concluded, as he placed a firm grip on his Kunai.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Those are just my feelings, however. I am unable to speak for anyone else.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:37> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc000492]><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja says, "aint we suppoed to scrap lol"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:48> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>observed the fools that desired to be fooled. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Indeed, &#39;tis as history said,&#34;</font> the lord of arachnae spoke. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;There is no one interested in justice, justice is a long gone concept,&#34;</font> he announced. The spiders kept climbing from his mouth gap, until the entire street seemed to be covered in ivory constructs of silk.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;One side brings shadow, the other brings light. But in the rushing tide, every human is the same; a stain. They shall inevitably choose for disorder, instead of order. You and your friends are proof of this disorder, a desire to be deceived by those that have committed atrocities, murdered families, ended heroes, destroyed competitors,&#34;</font> the ivory man stated.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;Enough talking. Let us begin this trial, bastard humans, children of the usurper,&#34;</font> he declared &#39;fore his armor plate fell into the ground. The ivory cloak floated in the air as silk wrapped around the entire area, constructing a colosseum of woven webs. Then, he held up his singular arm, screaming into the aether.

The scream ruptured ear drums, as the pale skin of the teenage soldier turned crimson. Pupils turned silver, veins began to bulge.. and then he rushed to chop the throat of his opponents at once as if an executioner.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:57> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>narrowed his gaze upon the Strange Man and his spider companions. Seems like talking was no longer an option, as he was preparing to get things underway. Truthfully, when he said he wanted to &#39;test&#39; the group of genin, Asahi thought that fighting group of people, kids as they may be, would put them at a disadvantage, however, he immediately eliminated that and it were not the Sound ninja who should be weary.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;So be it.&#34;</font>, asahi said, as his eyes shifted into a Crimson hue, one tomoe visible within them. He looked around at the surrounding area, and at the Spiders. It seems each and every one of them were embedded with Chakra, so dealing with them as well as him would be tricky. None the less, Asahi braced himself for what was to come. He was determined to prove to him that the Sound was better off without the truth that he spoke of.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:58> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>Jumps back in response to the &#39; Ivory Mans &#39; assault, <font color=#198aad>&#34; You do realize.. Regardless of which path we take. War or fighting is inevitable, only thing that changes is the opponent. Either way, I can&#39;t just stand here and let this go on, nothin personal. &#34;</font> 

Shenza puts up the tiger handseal while he puts distance between himself and the spiders. Surely, nothing good was going to come of this. If things keep on going this way someone would get hurt. Kill or be killed huh?<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 16:01> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc000492]><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja says, "ooc please :C"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 16:01> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>eye&#39;s became lighter, turning into a crimson color. The boy was confident in killing spiders, they were no different then a Deer or a wild animal in the forest, preparing himself for this &#39;battle&#39; this would be some training for him. With the grip tightened on the kunai, he moved his right hand with haste to collect some shruikens. With his hands now prepared for this.

His adrenaline rush kicked in. With his body tensing up, he was now ready to fight these spiders. Not knowing what this man had in his sleeves.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 16:01> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#c161bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>performs a quick warm-up exercise prior to the battle and assumes the combat dance stance of the Larch, preparing for it.

His first move would be an attempt to kill all the spiders in a single motion. Afterwards, he would join the rest in an attempt to defeat the stranger. The young Kaguya would utilize the Larch dance for the most part of the battle, but there&#39;s a chance that he would use the Camellia dance if the fight was too easy, or chakra scalpels if he was pushed to his limits. He wasn&#39;t exactly fond of fighting, so he would try his best to bring an end to the conflict as soon as possible.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
