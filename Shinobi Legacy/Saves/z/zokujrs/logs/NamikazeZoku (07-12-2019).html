<big><07/12/2019 13:08> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>shook his head, the person next to him couldn&#39;t wait to eat the riceball, fiddiling around in his backpack, he pulled out some water and handed it to him. <font color=#666699>&#34;Here, try not to drink all of it in one gulp. I&#39;m Uchiha, Kato. Pleasure to meet you.&#34;</font> He held out his hand for a formal greet.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:12> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>snaps out of his daze, and looks around him. Seems like Shenza and that other shonobi went their seperate ways. Now it was just kato, some fellow he hadn&#39;t seen before, and....some weird guy dressed in strange clothing?

Asahi found him to be oddbut there was bound to be a few weird individuals within the big world they inhabited. Thus, he shrugged it off, and walked towards the wall behind Kato and proceeded to lean on it.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Still reading?&#34;</font>, he asked with a light smile before waving towards the Other Sound Ninja.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:14> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Namikaze, Zoku <font color=yellow>nodded as Kato handed him some water aswell.However, he completely disregarded what he said and drank it in one gulp! The Namikaze let out a refreshing &#39;ahh&#39; and laid back on the bench.

<font color=#94ad8c>&#34;So Kato-san? Cool.&#34;</font>He said casually whilst giving him a firm handshake.With that out of the way, he turned his focus towards the other shinobi leaning against the wall <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;I was wondering when you&#39;d stop staring out into space like that.&#34;</font>He chuckled.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:14> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>|| Throughout his journey into the truth he traversed amongst the domains. His emperor had built them, but it seemed everybody did forget of his deeds. All that they could remember today? Slander of usurpers, unrighteous inheritors to the throne of a being beyond mankind.

The schwarzmantel stepped into another enemy domain. Otogakure, the land of plains. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;So close to home, yet so far from the truth,&#34;</font> the soldier said. It seemed he missed one arm, a scar from battle?<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:19> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Namikaze, Zoku <font color=yellow>watched as a strangely dressed person walked onto the scene.With buldging eyes, Zoku, stared at him with wonder! THE FASHION THESE DAYS! OUTRAGEOUS!

Calming himself down, he focused on the guy and noticed several things about him.The first thing he noticed was obviously the big kite-like thing he was wearing, but the most eye-catching was his missing arm...

<font color=#94ad8c>&#34;So.....Stranger-san......where do you hail from then?&#34;</font>He asked<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:21> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>pivoted his head to meet the gaze of the newcomer from his peripherals as he spoke. As Asahi continued to gaze and assess him, he noticed that one of the sleeves was just dangling and seemed to move with the breeze. was he missing an arm? or is it just within his clothing. Whatever the case, what he said was weird. What did he mean by &#39;so far from the truth&#39;? This thought lingered inside inside Asahi&#39;s mind like a never ending carousel.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;The Sound is your home?&#34;</font>, the lad inquired. <font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I haven&#39;t seen you around here before. Parhaps you&#39;re a shinobi returning from duty?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:24> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>stopped in one&#39;s steps &#39;fore he rotated his neck to face those that addressed him. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Where do you hail from then?&#34;</font> He repeated. Then, he traced his steps back to stand before the strangers. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Weiﬂmantel,&#34;</font> he admitted. The ancient order was but a mere conspiracy, removed repeatedly from historical records.

But, that&#39;d explain his strange fashion sense, for the ancient order wore intricate robes of ivory and silver.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:29> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Namikaze, Zoku <font color=yellow>rose up from his laid-back position, his elbows on his knees as he placed his face onto his hands, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Weelmantel? Sounds ancient....&#34;</font>He told him.The young Namikaze sighed as he watched the one-armed man just stand there.

Zoku smiled as he patted the seat next to him, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Well now im interested! Come sit and tell us about WEELMANTEL!&#34;</font>He told him.It wasnt that he was nosy or anything, its just......was there anything better to do right now?<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:31> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>squinted, as the Stranger answered the fellow Sound Ninja&#39;s question. Weiﬂmantel? What was that. Asahi had never heard such a weird sounding phrase before. The mention of that phrase made the young lad suspicious, but yet, at the same time, he was intrigued. Could this Weiﬂmantel thing be related to the truth he was talking about?

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I&#39;m sorry?&#34;</font>, Asahi said as he rose his body from up again the wall, and walked around the bench to get a better view of the Stranger. <font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve never heard of such a town or nation. What might that be?&#34;</font> he inquired.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:35> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0x0]><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja says, "Am I intruding?"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:36> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>reached for the bench. Each step, carried a heave of destruction, plummeting the concrete beneath the black sandals. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Weiﬂmantel is the ancient order constructed by the early emperor&#39;s advisor. Kanar created an orphanage and trained them into soldiers that kept the order,&#34;</font> he revealed as he stepped forth to the bench.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;Naturally, governments began to hunt us,&#34;</font> he continued on. It then became clear that this teenage soldier could also be an enemy to the government of this here domain, but that did not seem to bother the veteran child. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;It is a saddening fact that even you did not hear of the Weiﬂmantel that stopped the second world war.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:42> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>raised a brow at the unknown Shinobi, he zoned out what he was saying before. Being lost, he closed his book to see what did this person want. Closing the book, the crimson eyes turned into a dull red color. Clearing his throat.

<font color=#666699>&#34;Did you want something?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:43> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Namikaze, Zoku <font color=yellow>could see the damage this unknown shinobi was causing to the street, but what was he supposed to do about it? At first he took it as a sign of hostility, but soon displaced that theory when the weelmantel shinobi began to tell his story.

Zoku grimaced, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Hmm....Well I wont say that I believe you in that regards as I&#39;ve NEVER heard of your organization at all.....especially when if they were that important in the war, how could NO one know about them?&#34;</font>He stated plainly<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:46> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>| | The Uchiha&#39;s eyes widens, as he proceeded to leap back to a comfortable distance in response to not only the stranger&#39;s advancement or the very pavement giving in to the overwhelming pressure he was exerting, but rather the mention of Weiﬂmantel being related to the term &#39;Emperor&#39;. Though the world has known a brief time of peace and the newer generation had been sheltered from the past atrocities that were comitted during the war, stories and rumors have been spread down as time continued to pass, so Asahi knew that this Stranger was more or less dangerous, if not highly suspicious.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Why would someone in a group that was formed by the emperor&#39;s deceased advisor be here now of all times and places?&#34;</font>, Asahi asked as sweat rolled down the side of his face.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:51> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#d42780>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>flicked a lighter, letting the calm flames graze his cigarette. He would clip the lighter, closing it and depositing it back into his pockets. An index and middle finger would lace the outer material, giving way for smoke to exit from the tubular shape. 

Slowly, the same fingers would bring the cigarette down a little, so he could exhale. Seemed a scene had been boiling for what could have been some time. There were familiar clothes, but not familiar faces. Nevertheless, His take on the situation was as any comparable to his younger days. The cigaratte would take itself back to his lips, puffing again.

<font color=#d42780>&#34;Seems like I&#39;m late to the party. Whats wrong?&#34;</font> His pupils locked onto the most interesting figure, and as a response, they dilated. His fingers widened, the thin shaped cylinder dropping to the floor.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:13> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>chuckled at the ignorance, but he couldn&#39;t blame anyone. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Your government has lied to you,&#34;</font> he said, in pain and in grace, he rose his hand to the cosmos and made a fist. Blossoms did release from trees, like blood from the veins. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Schwarzmantel of the Weiﬂmantel. I do not belong in any domain, even though the emperor constructed them,&#34;</font> the messenger said.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;My duty as the blackcloak is simple, freund. I simply deliver the truth and sacrifice all that is necessary. I, a mere orphan, was accepted and taught as if family. That is the least I could do.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:20> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Namikaze, Zoku <font color=yellow>placed his face back onto his hands and let out a whistling noise, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;So basically....You&#39;re like a a remainant soldier from this organization named Welmantel and my government-well the current government has tracked you all down and is trying to demolish any information about you guys and your deeds?&#34;</font>He stated as a recap to what he was saying.

The reason he did so, was to help him process it all.It wasnt as though what he was saying was complicated or shocking, but it just didn&#39;t make sense to him.Why would the government want to discredit those that helped stop a war? 

Although that was a valid question, Zoku, wasn&#39;t the type to address something unless he felt absolutely necessary.So he decided to just nod and watch the unknown shinobi&#39;s mannerism...This guy was just too suspicious!<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:22> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc0004d1]><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja says, "9skip me for this round"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:23> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>still stood there, on the bench, placing his book in his pouch. He rised up off of the bench, Kato placed his hand on his chin. Absorbing all of the information that this &#39;shinobi&#39; was giving him, he had some questions for the shinobi.

<font color=#666699>&#34;So. . What did the &#39;government&#39; lie about?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:24> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0x0]><font color=#d4586b>Sound Ninja says, "WTF IS THIS BUG"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:31> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>stepped forth as the mantle danced upon the breeze. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Silence, that is the sound of your government,&#34;</font> he said as he pointed at the soldiers. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Isan delivered the end to his opponents, but for some odd reason, the sons and daughters of these leaders began to lead once more. The council hid information, solely to besmirch the emperor once more.&#34;</font>

A sigh rose from one&#39;s lips, <font color=#ffffff>&#34;there is soon to be a conflict once more. Weiﬂmantel sent me to find those responsible, to spread the message and to inform as many as possible. Weiﬂmantel was formed as an order to stop innocent bloodshed, but this road once more leads to just that.&#34;</font>

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;A third world war where many sacrifices will have to be made..&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:39> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Namikaze, Zoku <font color=yellow>was taken aback as watched the unknown shinobi.The way the man was speaking was if his organization was going to cause a third war? Zoku grimaced, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;I can understand-no I cant understand what your organizations has been through, but from what you&#39;re saying.....It sounds like you guys want a war? I aint down with that.&#34;</font>He announced.

<font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Im not for the government or against it...I am a shinobi, so i just follow orders, but id never be for something that wants war...ever,so I hope you aren&#39;t trying to  do this...&#34;</font>Zoku would then pull out a kunai.

What was this rookie shino<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:39> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Namikaze, Zoku <font color=yellow>//what was this rookie shinobi going to do with it?<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:41> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>lowers his eyelid, as he motions towards the back of his hit, and placed his hand on top of his Kunai holster just encase the worse case situation were to happen.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;The past is the past. All we can do is to look at what our previous mistakes have done to the Shinodi world without dwelling on it, for that wouldn&#39;t help us in todat&#39;s present.&#34;</font>, Asahi began to say.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;There is bound to be conflict once more, but unlike what happened in the war years ago I will ensure that the Sound be prepared for it, so no sacrifices are casualties are to happen. I don&#39;t know if what you&#39;re saying about the Government is true or not, nor do i have the means to verify it. However, if that&#39;s what it takes to bring about a longer time of peace, then I wouldn&#39;t mind those who they govern to remain ignorant to the truth.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:46> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>would listen in as he propped his foot up on the wall.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:51> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>grinned in delight &#39;fore he held open his hand. Then, a hundred spiders began to climb from the gap of the grin. Each spider had a name, each an individual, prepared to give in their flame for the truth. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;We do not desire bloodshed, ,&#34;</font> the blackcloak stated &#39;fore he placed a finger underneath his eyelid.

Then, a crimson spider began to climb from the slit. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Shin,&#34;</font> he called the spider, once he looked on at the soldiers of the enemy domain. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;We were put here on this earth to feel nothing but pain,&#34;</font> he said to the spider.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;I&#39;ve seen many ignore the truth solely to protect their circle, but, the truth cannot be forgotten. The web we weaved in the past shall catch those flies that spread their lies. Do you know what spiders have in common with humans?&#34;</font> He questioned those before him.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;They devour each other.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:51> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Namikaze, Zoku <font color=yellow>pulled out an apple and begins to peel the skin with the kunai, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Not that I can do anything about right now.&#34;</font>He said.The young Namikaze would then began to whistle as he dwindled away the foreskin of the apple.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/13/2019 00:35> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#f07a2d>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>just takes a seat down on the bench, crossing one leg over the other. As the Namikaze passed him, he just gives a smile and a wave.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/13/2019 00:38> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Namikaze, Zoku <font color=yellow>scratched the back of his head <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Ugh......This technique is so complicated!&#34;</font>He said sternly.The young man would then turn his attention towards the Uchiha sitting on the bench.Zoku smirked, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Perfect! Help me out okay?&#34;</font>He said.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/13/2019 00:38> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc000529]><font color=#f07a2d>Sound Ninja says, "Hm? What technique do you need help with?"</font></font><br></big>

<big><07/13/2019 00:45> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Namikaze, Zoku <font color=yellow>stared at the Uchiha with a very serious countenance as he began to control his breathing.He could feel the air entering his lungs, slowly permeating his entire body and revitalizing his cells.

Zoku&#39;s eyes closed, his thoughts clear and his mind open.Slowly he drew upon his chakra and visualized its network.The chakra flowed without interruption, travelling towards his legs then feet, and finally his toes.

It was at that moment, his eyes shot open and his body moved with transcendant speed! Zoku visualized himself behind the Uchiha, but he ended up crashing to the ground behind him due to a mis-step in his chakra control...<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/13/2019 00:46> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc0005b9]><font color=#94ad8c>Namikaze, Zoku says, "Damn..."</font></font><br></big>

Then, suddenly, he&#39;s zipping and zooming around the Namikaze! <font color=#f07a2d>&#34;Perhaps you need some further training?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/13/2019 00:53> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Namikaze, Zoku <font color=yellow>was left shocked by the shinobi before him.His karakuri was so agile, yet refined! He did&#39;nt event feel any wind pressure from him going around him rapidly like that! 

<font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Damn.....Wait wait.....did you bend your knees?&#34;</font>He asked before facepalming himself, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Hold up...let me try this again.&#34;</font>He stated whilst body flickering back a bit.With ample room, he went at it again, except he bent his knees a bit.

Be careful with it though, as it takes lots of stamina to keep up with it.&#34;</font> That being said, with the bursts of speed that the Uchiha demonstrated, he seemed quite tired, and went back to the bench to rest.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
