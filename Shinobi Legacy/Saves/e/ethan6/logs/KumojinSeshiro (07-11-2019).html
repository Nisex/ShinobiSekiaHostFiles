<big><07/11/2019 10:46> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>robes jerk as he makes his way through the oddly quiet Sound village. His eyes are directed to the ground, his hands were hidden by the sleeves of his long robe. As well has the majority of his face which was hidden by his neck-band. His dark red hair blew in the warm air as he walked. Eventually his gaze rested on a nearby bench, a sigh could be heard through his neckband shirt as he proceeded to sit down. <font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 10:50> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>adjusted his headband, as he was reading a book on Genjutsu. Being focused on the book, he decided to train his eyes, because why not? Using the Sharingan while reading, was causing strains all throughout his eyes, putting the book down to rub his eyes he saw that someone was on the bench, shrugging it off. Couldn&#39;t hurt to make any friends.

<font color=#666699>&#34;Hello.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/11/2019 11:01> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>Ears ring as a voice disturbs his gaze, the words Hello rang in his head as he turned towards the ninja. A sound headband rested on his forehead, it seemed to be well taken care of as it&#39;s shine had remained. He nods towards the ninja as a light voice is let out of his mouth: <font color=#198aad>&#34; Hello. &#34;</font> He looks at the book that the ninja was apparently reading, a ninjustu book. The ninjas eyes were red just like his own. His eyes look so weird.... It&#39;s like a leaf is under his pupil. It looks like it puts a strain on his eyes though, evident by the deep concentration.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 11:06> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>raised the genjutsu book, showing it to the boy. Raising a brow at the pupils, it wasn&#39;t something that you see in the average ninja. Opening the book he showed him the pictures and words that was coming out of the book. But, he placed the book back down. To rub his eyes, his eyes were getting strained by the minute.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 11:09> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>walked up towards the two whom were seated in the central area of the village, and decided to join them as he had almost nothing better to do. He leaned against the wall and folded his arms after giving a short wave to one of his fellow clansmen.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 11:12> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Shenza <font color=yellow><font color=#198aad>&#34; Genjustu huh... I&#39;ve never been good at it. &#34;</font> He seemed to be actively reading the book before the ninja put the book down to rub his eyes. <font color=#198aad>&#34; Does that hurt? &#34;</font> He could hear footsteps approaching from behind them and he turned around. Another sound ninja, eveident from the headband. He waved at them as he rested his back on the wall. Shenza nods, greeting the ninja before looking back at the ninja holding the book. <font color=#198aad>&#34; I&#39;m Shenza. &#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 11:18> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow><font color=#666699>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t say hurt. . Just burns a lot.&#34;</font> He moved his hands off of his eyes, to see his surroundings again. He looked at the new Ninja that came, waving at him. The crimson eyes went back to it&#39;s dull color. Picking up his book <font color=#666699>&#34;I&#39;m Kato, from the Uchiha Clan.&#34;</font> He opened the book to see where they left off. Skipping through pages, he found the page. <font color=#666699>&#34;With enough reading, you&#39;ll be good at it.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 11:24> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>slightly lowers his eyes as he continued to examine the Uchiha. Seems he already unlocked his Sharingan. That in itself seperated him from most of the clansmen, for only a few are even capable of using it, let alone at a young age. He surely had potential within him.

As the Shinobi started to introduce themselves, Asahi began to raise his upper body off from the wall, and took a seat next to Shemzu. The two seemed to be pretty alright, which eased his mind a bit more to actively converse with them.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Pardon me, Shenza right?&#34;</font>, the young lad said,shuffling the to left corner of the bench to give Shenza some space.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I&#39;m Asahi, also a member of the uchiha clan. Pleasure to meet both of you.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 11:27> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc00056f]><font color=#198aad>Shenza says, "1 sec"</font></font><br></big>

Gifted at birth. &#34;</font> Shenza lets out a small laugh as he continues reading, admiring the pictures. It seems that the most Genjustu that he&#39;d ever be able to perform was something like the Darkness technique. <font color=#198aad>&#34; Maybe I&#39;ll pick that up sometime.... &#34;</font> he mutters.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 11:42> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>wasn&#39;t his first time reading this book, he had to look at some of these Genjutsu, since some seemed cool to him. There was circles on the picture to show that he wanted to learn the Genjutsu <font color=#666699>&#34;Well, elaborate more on &#39;gifted at birth&#39;. Most of us train alot at  a young age.&#34;</font> He adjusted his headband. <font color=#666699>&#34;Asahi, are you going to learn Genjutsu, when you have the time?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 11:43> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc00056f]><font color=#198aad>Shenza says, "I meant as in your clan."</font></font><br></big>

<big><07/11/2019 11:46> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>shrugged, as he pivoted his head slightly ro the right and looked at Kato from his peripherals.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I&#39;m studying how to do it, but don&#39;t have any actual jutsu yet.&#34;</font>, he said as a means to answer the fellow Uchiha&#39;s question.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;and I disagree with you on hat, Shenzu. You could be born unto the best bloodline but without any actual skill or practice you wont really amount to anything.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 11:47> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc00055d]><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja says, "sa8 It&#39;s shenza"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 11:56> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Shenza <font color=yellow><font color=#198aad>&#34; Just makes it a little easier that&#39;s all... &#34;</font> Noticing that the fatigue in his legs had dissapeared. Shenza decides to stand up and stretch, letting out a deep breath. How refreshing.. He cracks his knuckles before asking the ninja a question. <font color=#198aad>&#34; Anyone up for a spar? I was training before I got here, so why not. &#34;</font>

His red eyes bounce between the two ninja, wondering if they&#39;d accept his request. A small breeze passes by the ninja, lifting his robes up a little, dark eight legged insects seemed to be crawling within the robes. Eventually the breeze passes by allowing his robes to rest, securing the insects. <font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 12:01> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Uchiha, Kato <font color=yellow><font color=#666699>&#34;Right, think it&#39;s time to continue my reading.&#34;</font> Picking himself up off of the ground, Kato took his book with him and waved towards the new &#39;friends&#39;. He was going to return home and probably nap. <font color=#666699>&#34;Have fun sparring.&#34;</font> Now walking off to his house.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 12:02> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc00056f]><font color=#198aad>Shenza says, "Was nice to meet you, cya."</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 13:26> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#329aa9>Rain Ninja <font color=yellow>waited a bit to respond before he simply responded, later. <font color=#329aa9>&#34;Uhh I never said there was anything wrong with it.&#34;</font> he said bluntly before finally capping the bottle of water.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 13:37> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Shenza <font color=yellow>The village that rested before him seemed to be clouded by fog. Tall buildings and bridges were hidden by the fog that surrounded it. Overtaken by curiousity the ninja ventures in, oblivious as to what he may find. A sign stood tall in front of him which read: Amegakure. He squinted his eyes as he made his way through the mist, walking slowly as his hair soon became damp due to the rain. As he went further into the village, he saw twin doors that seemed to have light creeping from under them. &lt; So it isn&#39;t empty... &gt; He slowly walked towards the doors.

Pushing them open as he poked his head through, there seemed to be two ninja sitting on the chairs of the building. One who he recognized slightly, only seeing him pass by in his home village. That put him at ease for a while as he walked inside. He gave a nod to both of the ninja as he continued to walk inside. <font color=#198aad>&#34; Am I interrupting something? &#34;</font> The aura of the room was moreso calm so he felt welcomed as he sat on one of the chairs in the room.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 13:53> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#c161bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>scratched his head, because the stranger said his clothes are weird, but now said that there&#39;s nothing wrong with them,
 
<font color=#c161bd>&#34;&lt;How were they weird then?&gt;&#34;</font> he thought. 

The kid decided to drop this topic, since he couldn&#39;t understand the other guy, and moved onto a new one.

<font color=#c161bd>&#34;So..this is a really nice village, but it&#39;s probably even more quiet than otogakure, so many buildings, yet it&#39;s silent-- Actually...that&#39;s a good thing, and any place is better than my village...because the hidden sound village reminds me of......nevermind.&#34;</font> 

The young shinobi would stand up and throw the bottle he emptied into a trash can. He would ignore the fellow otogakure ninja.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 13:59> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc000494]><font color=#198aad>Shenza says, "he&#39;s not afk.)_"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 14:06> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#329aa9>Rain Ninja <font color=yellow>looked around the village after they commented on it. He didn&#39;t have that many fond memories of it. well he did, but tha&#39;ts neither here nor there it felt as he moved his hand over to unstrap the weeapon from his shoulders to pat his shoulders a bit after he set the large blade against his side. <font color=#329aa9>&#34;Ow..&#34;</font> He said as he massaged himself a few more times ebfore he eventually sighed.

<font color=#329aa9>&#34;It&#39;s..okay.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 14:10> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Shenza <font color=yellow>&lt;p style=<font color=#198aad>&#34;display: none;&#34;</font>&gt; test &lt;/p&gt;<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 14:21> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Shenza <font color=yellow>Seeing as though he&#39;s been ignored he decides to relax and listen in. The conversation was rather odd as he couldn&#39;t really grab the main topic of it. Something about the village? <font color=#198aad>&#34; What happened to your shoulder? Or is it just sore from that huge sword on your back. &#34;</font> 

The ninja seemed to be able to lift it up easily, maybe strong in taijustu? The headband on the ninjas forehead suggested that he was of the rain village. After all, this was the rain village so that&#39;s to be expected. On the other hand, he did wonder why a ninja from his own village would be here. Could it be similar to his own reasoning?<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 14:38> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#990033>Rain Ninja <font color=yellow>shook his head briefly to the queston. <font color=#990033>&#34;I&#39;m used to to the weight of the sword, I have to be since it&#39;s my weapon of choice, the weight can be an issue, at times.&#34;</font> He nodded to himself a bit as he sighed patting his arm a bit. When he was thinking about it he didn&#39;t seem to have done anything to it? Maybe it&#39;s just from sleeping on ti wrong.

<font color=#990033>&#34;I think I&#39;ll be fine. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s form the weight...at least I hope not.&#34;</font> The pain seemed to be easing slightly, but it wasa still there, he just wanted to take a small break from having his weapon strapped to his shoulders for a bit. He still sighed a bit as he rubbed the  nape of his neck, there were two Ninjas from Otogakure it seemed. He did immidately assume something was going to happen, but, nothing of yet as occured, for now at least.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

Two boulders clumped together were shown on the shiny covering. Rock ninja? Why are they here? <font color=#198aad>&#34; Uh, what is going on? Why are you guys... Here... &#34;</font> His gaze rested on the apparent sand user that rested before him.

They said Sound ninja were soft? What do I care, words don&#39;t mean anything around here. <font color=#198aad>&#34; I don&#39;t really care for fighting people like that. You called this other guy an Elder? Who&#39;s that? &#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

He searched the village high and low to no avail. He was begnning to seriously worry that the person who oozed danger might have kidnapped him. He hoped that wasn&#39;t the case.

However, as he began to descend the final flight of stairs, it was much worse than he could have ever anticipated. 

Whilst The Elder and Asahi was worrying, here he was at the outskirts of the village, seemingly getting his neck licked.

Asahi stopped in his tracks, as a dark shadow looked over his upper face, making his eyes barely visible. He took his right hand out of his pocket, and rubbed his hand with a rather loud sigh that might have cought both of there attention.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I didn&#39;t think you were that type of guy, Kato. Guess I judged you too early.&#34;</font>, the young lad began to say as he turned his back to his clansmen. 

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Sorry for interupting. Just wanted to make sure you were ok.&#34;</font>, Asahi said, as he lowered his hand from his face and formed a fist as his body trembled.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;By the way, this may have been what you were studying for...But I hear Genjutsu makes this kind of thing more enjoyable for some!&#34;</font>, he said as he dashed back to the village. he was mroe dramatic than he needed to be, but giving Kato a little scare wouldn&#39;t hurt.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/11/2019 23:45> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ec4ffe>Yotsuki, Jahin <font color=yellow>began walking away from the two of them, turning to face them and give them both a nod, stopping briefly while looking at the Uchiha.

<font color=#ec4ffe>&#34;My name&#39;s Jahin, by the way. I&#39;m one of the Yotsukis.&#34;</font> He stood there in his spot, as if he were awaiting a response from him.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 23:48> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Uchiha, Kato <font color=yellow>eyes peeled off of the book as he heard the clan <font color=#666699>&#34;Yotsuki&#34;</font>, chuckling to himself. He knew only one thing about them. &#39;Lightning&#39; was no joke, if it was coming from them. Kato nodded at Jahin <font color=#666699>&#34;Be safe, if you see that rock shinobi. Suggest you run from &#39;em. Their weird.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 23:51> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ec4ffe>Yotsuki, Jahin <font color=yellow>squinted his eyes towards the Uchiha as he gave him another look over, his facing completely changing as if a bright lightbulb had went off infront of his face, letting out a quiet laugh towards him, grinning afterwards as he turned back around. 

<font color=#ec4ffe>&#34;Oh! That&#39;s right...you were the one that had gotten licked earlier. I didn&#39;t recognize you. Same goes for you.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 23:51> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc0005ea]><font color=#198aad>Shenza says, "If he licks me I&#39;m killing him no joke."</font></font><br></big>

<big><07/12/2019 00:00> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Uchiha, Kato <font color=yellow>made the crimson eyes dull, returning to the maroon color, it was time for him to head home and go to sleep. He was tired and his eyes were strained as hell for training his eyes. Getting up off of the Bench, he waved at Shenza, walking towards his house, he actually began to take off, without hesitation. It seemed that he wanted to go home fast and jump on his bed.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 00:59> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0x0]><font color=#198aad>Shenza says, "*sniffs*"</font></font><br></big>

<big><07/12/2019 10:48> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Shenza <font color=yellow>On his way throughout the Sound Village, he lays his eyes on an old friend of his. His eyes were still Blood red and Shenza could tell by his face that it was still putting a strain on him. As he approached Kato he smiled and said: <font color=#198aad>&#34; Don&#39;t kill yourself. &#34;</font> <font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 10:50> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#9966ff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>sat in a squatting position on the wall of the Uchiha district. They had no intention of causing trouble, just simply watching the shinobi who were just talking.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 10:52> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Uchiha, Asahi <font color=yellow>| | <font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Yo.&#34;</font>, Asahi said from the roof top above Kato before leaping down and  coming to his side. He gave a light smile and a little wave before leaning against the bench with his left arm seeing as how the other seat was already taken.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;My bad about yesterday. I was joking but it seemed that it got to you more than I expected.&#34;</font>, the lad said while scratching the side of his face. He noticed that Shenza was also herre ahd offered a wave to him aswell.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;So, what are you up to Kato? I figured, if you&#39;re not busy maybe we can do a little training together.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 10:52> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0x0]><font color=#198aad>Shenza says, "Pie, are u searching for a Playby?"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 10:53> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Uchiha, Kato <font color=yellow>raised his head towards the voice, with him rubbing his eyes, the boy placed the book back down. <font color=#666699>&#34;Well, it&#39;s almost like it is.&#34;</font> he skipped through the pages of the books and saw that Asahi was there, nodding his head at him. <font color=#666699>&#34;Wasn&#39;t that funny, Shenza joked around with it too. We can train later, after I finish this chapter.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 10:59> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Shenza <font color=yellow>gave Asahi a light wave as he looked towards Kota as he planned to make another joke about it. He then noticed that they had a visitor and he whispers to Kota: <font color=#198aad>&#34; Isn&#39;t that, that same guy from before.... &#34;</font> He thinks to himself, &lt; Who even is this guy &gt;. Shenza decides not to confront him just yet but he is on guard now. <font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 11:03> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Uchiha, Asahi <font color=yellow>gave a small nod, before starting to practice handseals for a new jutsu he had learned from an Elder clansmen. 

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;So, how&#39;s your Genjutsu looking Kato? I&#39;ve been working on it myself, along with a few Ninjutsu here and there.&#34;</font>, he asked inquisitively.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 11:20> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Uchiha, Kato <font color=yellow>held out his book, pointing at the illustration. It showed a blizzard happening, surrounding a person. <font color=#666699>&#34;I&#39;m focusin&#39; on this, might be something. I&#39;ll need in the future. What have you been workin&#39; on?&#34;</font> The crimson eyes peeled off of the book and laid upon Asahi.

<font color=#666699>&#34;With enough practice, I can do it.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 11:24> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#9966ff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>does not move from their spot and makes little to no sound. Their eyes widen the more they observed Kato and the book he&#39;s reading before moving their attention to Asahi and Shenza.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 11:29> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Uchiha, Asahi <font color=yellow>peers over towards Shenza. He appeared to be on guard, most likely due to the strange ninja&#39;s appearence. Asahi had been aware of their presense, for he had felt another Chakra signature approach when his Sharingan was active, but chose to ignore them seeing as how they weren&#39;t doing anything and talking about them would make Kato uncomfortable, which would have been pretty funny to see actually.

He focused most of his attention back to Kato, and resumed to speak.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Ah, I know that one. It&#39;s really useful, glad you&#39;re picking it up.&#34;</font>, Asahi began to say. <font color=#71a6bd>&#34;And I&#39;ve been working on my Ninjutsu and Weapon skills recently. I finished my Taijutsu training yesterday. I&#39;m not the strongest of Shinobi but it&#39;d be good to have that kind of experience under my belt.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 11:37> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Uchiha, Kato <font color=yellow><font color=#666699>&#34;Oh, that&#39;s cool. I haven&#39;t trained my Taijutsu yet, but I&#39;ll do it when I have the time.&#34;</font> He squinted his eyes at both of them, there was something funny. Shenza was on guard but for what? Lowering his book there was two Chakra&#39;s that he was seeing. Placing his head in the book. The boy seemed like he saw a ghost, he didn&#39;t want no trouble at the moment. Since he was learning.

<font color=#666699>&#34;Psst. . Let&#39;s go.&#34;</font> He whispered.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 11:40> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ec4ffe>Yotsuki, Jahin <font color=yellow>gave a short wave towards the group of people near the bench as he walked up to it, crossing his arms while standing close to the bench itself as he spoke up.

<font color=#ec4ffe>&#34;Sup Shenza and...Guy that was licked. I don&#39;t think I actually got your name when we met the last time.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 11:41> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc0004d2]><font color=#666699>Uchiha, Kato says, ". . . Right, Uchiha, Kato."</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 11:46> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Shenza <font color=yellow>After a while, Shenza lowers his guard and labels him as a creep before returning his gaze to Jahin. He was glad that Jahin had arrived to reduce a little bit of tension. <font color=#198aad>&#34; Hey Jahin. The whole group is here once again huh? &#34;</font> 

<font color=#198aad>&#34; Anyways, Asahi. You said something about training right? Got anywhere in mind? &#34;</font> He nods at Kato, letting him know that he heard him.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 11:47> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc00050d]><font color=#ec4ffe>Yotsuki, Jahin says, "Whole group? I guess we have been seeing each other around a lot."</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 11:47> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0x0]><font color=#198aad>Shenza says, "For the past few days now, mhm."</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 11:51> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#9966ff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>notices that the group is becoming a little too big to their liking. They frowned and slips backwards.

<font color=#9966ff>&#34;Next time, Kato Uchiha.&#34;</font> They whispered as they take their leave.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 11:51> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Uchiha, Asahi <font color=yellow>lowered his eyes and gave a light smile towards Kato. He seemed pretty shakin up about this person. Perhaps leaving him with them was the wrong call, but there was more enough people there to watch his back. Besides, he couldn&#39;t exactly say no after he was branded &#39;the guy who was licked&#39; because of him.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Alright.&#34;</font>, he started to whisper back <font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Where would you like to go?&#34;</font>, he asked as he gave a small wave towards the the other Wild haired Shinobi who appraoached.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 11:59> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Uchiha, Kato <font color=yellow><font color=#666699>&#34;Uh. . . Maybe to another bench spot?&#34;</font> He whispered back, as he closed to book, with his facial expression slowly returning to normal. He saw the rock shinobi was leaving. Kato whispered again <font color=#666699>&#34;Actually, they are leavin&#39; so we can stay, here.&#34;</font> He laid the book out infront of him.

<font color=#666699>&#34;We should play a game.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/12/2019 13:36> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>reached for the bench. Each step, carried a heave of destruction, plummeting the concrete beneath the black sandals. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Weimantel is the ancient order constructed by the early emperor&#39;s advisor. Kanar created an orphanage and trained them into soldiers that kept the order,&#34;</font> he revealed as he stepped forth to the bench.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;Naturally, governments began to hunt us,&#34;</font> he continued on. It then became clear that this teenage soldier could also be an enemy to the government of this here domain, but that did not seem to bother the veteran child. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;It is a saddening fact that even you did not hear of the Weimantel that stopped the second world war.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:42> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Uchiha, Kato <font color=yellow>raised a brow at the unknown Shinobi, he zoned out what he was saying before. Being lost, he closed his book to see what did this person want. Closing the book, the crimson eyes turned into a dull red color. Clearing his throat.

<font color=#666699>&#34;Did you want something?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:43> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>could see the damage this unknown shinobi was causing to the street, but what was he supposed to do about it? At first he took it as a sign of hostility, but soon displaced that theory when the weelmantel shinobi began to tell his story.

Zoku grimaced, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Hmm....Well I wont say that I believe you in that regards as I&#39;ve NEVER heard of your organization at all.....especially when if they were that important in the war, how could NO one know about them?&#34;</font>He stated plainly<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:46> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Uchiha, Asahi <font color=yellow>| | The Uchiha&#39;s eyes widens, as he proceeded to leap back to a comfortable distance in response to not only the stranger&#39;s advancement or the very pavement giving in to the overwhelming pressure he was exerting, but rather the mention of Weimantel being related to the term &#39;Emperor&#39;. Though the world has known a brief time of peace and the newer generation had been sheltered from the past atrocities that were comitted during the war, stories and rumors have been spread down as time continued to pass, so Asahi knew that this Stranger was more or less dangerous, if not highly suspicious.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Why would someone in a group that was formed by the emperor&#39;s deceased advisor be here now of all times and places?&#34;</font>, Asahi asked as sweat rolled down the side of his face.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:51> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#d42780>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>flicked a lighter, letting the calm flames graze his cigarette. He would clip the lighter, closing it and depositing it back into his pockets. An index and middle finger would lace the outer material, giving way for smoke to exit from the tubular shape. 

Slowly, the same fingers would bring the cigarette down a little, so he could exhale. Seemed a scene had been boiling for what could have been some time. There were familiar clothes, but not familiar faces. Nevertheless, His take on the situation was as any comparable to his younger days. The cigaratte would take itself back to his lips, puffing again.

<font color=#d42780>&#34;Seems like I&#39;m late to the party. Whats wrong?&#34;</font> His pupils locked onto the most interesting figure, and as a response, they dilated. His fingers widened, the thin shaped cylinder dropping to the floor.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

Blossoms did release from trees, like blood from the veins. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Schwarzmantel of the Weimantel. I do not belong in any domain, even though the emperor constructed them,&#34;</font> the messenger said.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;My duty as the blackcloak is simple, freund. I simply deliver the truth and sacrifice all that is necessary. I, a mere orphan, was accepted and taught as if family. That is the least I could do.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:20> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>placed his face back onto his hands and let out a whistling noise, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;So basically....You&#39;re like a a remainant soldier from this organization named Welmantel and my government-well the current government has tracked you all down and is trying to demolish any information about you guys and your deeds?&#34;</font>He stated as a recap to what he was saying.

The reason he did so, was to help him process it all.It wasnt as though what he was saying was complicated or shocking, but it just didn&#39;t make sense to him.Why would the government want to discredit those that helped stop a war? 

Although that was a valid question, Zoku, wasn&#39;t the type to address something unless he felt absolutely necessary.So he decided to just nod and watch the unknown shinobi&#39;s mannerism...This guy was just too suspicious!<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

He rised up off of the bench, Kato placed his hand on his chin. Absorbing all of the information that this &#39;shinobi&#39; was giving him, he had some questions for the shinobi.

<font color=#666699>&#34;So. . What did the &#39;government&#39; lie about?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:24> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0x0]><font color=#d4586b>Sound Ninja says, "WTF IS THIS BUG"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:31> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>stepped forth as the mantle danced upon the breeze. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Silence, that is the sound of your government,&#34;</font> he said as he pointed at the soldiers. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Isan delivered the end to his opponents, but for some odd reason, the sons and daughters of these leaders began to lead once more. The council hid information, solely to besmirch the emperor once more.&#34;</font>

A sigh rose from one&#39;s lips, <font color=#ffffff>&#34;there is soon to be a conflict once more. Weimantel sent me to find those responsible, to spread the message and to inform as many as possible. Weimantel was formed as an order to stop innocent bloodshed, but this road once more leads to just that.&#34;</font>

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;A third world war where many sacrifices will have to be made..&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:39> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>was taken aback as watched the unknown shinobi.The way the man was speaking was if his organization was going to cause a third war? Zoku grimaced, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;I can understand-no I cant understand what your organizations has been through, but from what you&#39;re saying.....It sounds like you guys want a war? I aint down with that.&#34;</font>He announced.

<font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Im not for the government or against it...I am a shinobi, so i just follow orders, but id never be for something that wants war...ever,so I hope you aren&#39;t trying to  do this...&#34;</font>Zoku would then pull out a kunai.

What was this rookie shino<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:39> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>//what was this rookie shinobi going to do with it?<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:41> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Uchiha, Asahi <font color=yellow>lowers his eyelid, as he motions towards the back of his hit, and placed his hand on top of his Kunai holster just encase the worse case situation were to happen.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;The past is the past. All we can do is to look at what our previous mistakes have done to the Shinodi world without dwelling on it, for that wouldn&#39;t help us in todat&#39;s present.&#34;</font>, Asahi began to say.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;There is bound to be conflict once more, but unlike what happened in the war years ago I will ensure that the Sound be prepared for it, so no sacrifices are casualties are to happen. I don&#39;t know if what you&#39;re saying about the Government is true or not, nor do i have the means to verify it. However, if that&#39;s what it takes to bring about a longer time of peace, then I wouldn&#39;t mind those who they govern to remain ignorant to the truth.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/12/2019 14:51> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>grinned in delight &#39;fore he held open his hand. Then, a hundred spiders began to climb from the gap of the grin. Each spider had a name, each an individual, prepared to give in their flame for the truth. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;We do not desire bloodshed, ,&#34;</font> the blackcloak stated &#39;fore he placed a finger underneath his eyelid.

Then, a crimson spider began to climb from the slit. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Shin,&#34;</font> he called the spider, once he looked on at the soldiers of the enemy domain. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;We were put here on this earth to feel nothing but pain,&#34;</font> he said to the spider.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;I&#39;ve seen many ignore the truth solely to protect their circle, but, the truth cannot be forgotten. The web we weaved in the past shall catch those flies that spread their lies. Do you know what spiders have in common with humans?&#34;</font> He questioned those before him.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;They devour each other.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/12/2019 14:54> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Uchiha, Kato <font color=yellow>grew bored, this didn&#39;t interest him at all.

When he heard, that the strange man just challenged them to a battle in order to see if they are prepared for battle, he approached the group and stopped next to the bench.

The young genin really hated the word <font color=#c161bd>&#34;war&#34;</font>, since it took his entire family from him, and he really hoped that it&#39;s possible to avoid another one....Sadly it was highely unlikely, so the best move would be accepting the challenge, and finding out about his combat capabilities before it&#39;s too late.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;I, Kumojin, Adateus shall take their mantle of sacrifice. My intention is not bloodshed, but true peace under the return of the emperor. If you desire, you can join me and find out the truth for yourself, or you can keep being fooled by your government, used as livestock to keep their power afloat.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

There was disinterest in their demeanor to the whole speech.

In fact, Stitch settles for reclining on the rooftop of the wall, awaiting for at least Kato&#39;s opinion on it.

Even though he was supposedly &#39;testing&#39; them, perhaps this may have been too much for a bunch of genin to fight off.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I don&#39;t mind if the Government continues to deceive the people they have governed, for it has continuously brought us peace, and for once a time of prosperity. Engaging in conflict with the Emperor once more would only serve to reenact the past atrocities commited, for the Emperor himself was also willing to make sacrifices, no matter what it may have been. And look where that got him. For those reasons, I&#39;ll have to decline your offer, as much as a fool it would make me.&#34;</font>, the lad concluded, as he placed a firm grip on his Kunai.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Those are just my feelings, however. I am unable to speak for anyone else.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/12/2019 15:37> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Uchiha, Kato <font color=yellow>looked at the spiders , they were growing in numbers. All he wanted to do is train, but he was stopped by these spiders and Shinobi. He didn&#39;t care for the speech or anything, it was pointless to him. He thought it was just a person trying to convince him for something stupid. Kato reached down to his kunai holster, thinking this can be some time of training for him.

<font color=#666699>&#34;Look, listen, I don&#39;t care for this.&#34;</font> His set his target on the spiders other then the Man who created them.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:48> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>observed the fools that desired to be fooled. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Indeed, &#39;tis as history said,&#34;</font> the lord of arachnae spoke. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;There is no one interested in justice, justice is a long gone concept,&#34;</font> he announced. The spiders kept climbing from his mouth gap, until the entire street seemed to be covered in ivory constructs of silk.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;One side brings shadow, the other brings light. But in the rushing tide, every human is the same; a stain. They shall inevitably choose for disorder, instead of order. You and your friends are proof of this disorder, a desire to be deceived by those that have committed atrocities, murdered families, ended heroes, destroyed competitors,&#34;</font> the ivory man stated.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;Enough talking. Let us begin this trial, bastard humans, children of the usurper,&#34;</font> he declared &#39;fore his armor plate fell into the ground. The ivory cloak floated in the air as silk wrapped around the entire area, constructing a colosseum of woven webs. Then, he held up his singular arm, screaming into the aether.

The scream ruptured ear drums, as the pale skin of the teenage soldier turned crimson. Pupils turned silver, veins began to bulge.. and then he rushed to chop the throat of his opponents at once as if an executioner.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:57> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Uchiha, Asahi <font color=yellow>narrowed his gaze upon the Strange Man and his spider companions. Seems like talking was no longer an option, as he was preparing to get things underway. Truthfully, when he said he wanted to &#39;test&#39; the group of genin, Asahi thought that fighting group of people, kids as they may be, would put them at a disadvantage, however, he immediately eliminated that and it were not the Sound ninja who should be weary.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;So be it.&#34;</font>, asahi said, as his eyes shifted into a Crimson hue, one tomoe visible within them. He looked around at the surrounding area, and at the Spiders. It seems each and every one of them were embedded with Chakra, so dealing with them as well as him would be tricky. None the less, Asahi braced himself for what was to come. He was determined to prove to him that the Sound was better off without the truth that he spoke of.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:58> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Shenza <font color=yellow>Jumps back in response to the &#39; Ivory Mans &#39; assault, <font color=#198aad>&#34; You do realize.. Regardless of which path we take. War or fighting is inevitable, only thing that changes is the opponent. Either way, I can&#39;t just stand here and let this go on, nothin personal. &#34;</font> 

Shenza puts up the tiger handseal while he puts distance between himself and the spiders. Surely, nothing good was going to come of this. If things keep on going this way someone would get hurt. Kill or be killed huh?<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/12/2019 16:01> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Uchiha, Kato <font color=yellow>eye&#39;s became lighter, turning into a crimson color. The boy was confident in killing spiders, they were no different then a Deer or a wild animal in the forest, preparing himself for this &#39;battle&#39; this would be some training for him. With the grip tightened on the kunai, he moved his right hand with haste to collect some shruikens. With his hands now prepared for this.

His adrenaline rush kicked in. With his body tensing up, he was now ready to fight these spiders. Not knowing what this man had in his sleeves.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 16:01> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#c161bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>performs a quick warm-up exercise prior to the battle and assumes the combat dance stance of the Larch, preparing for it.

His first move would be an attempt to kill all the spiders in a single motion. Afterwards, he would join the rest in an attempt to defeat the stranger. The young Kaguya would utilize the Larch dance for the most part of the battle, but there&#39;s a chance that he would use the Camellia dance if the fight was too easy, or chakra scalpels if he was pushed to his limits. He wasn&#39;t exactly fond of fighting, so he would try his best to bring an end to the conflict as soon as possible.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

He&#39;d glance at the person who is on the ground then at the man whom had spiders under his command.

He&#39;d click his tongue, not really caring what happened. He just been waiting for a good fight. He&#39;d rise his hands up, untwisting his turban from off of his cranium. He&#39;d stuff it into his robe&#39;s interior pocket.

He&#39;d approach the fainted pale man on the ground, completely ignoring the long haired freak who glared at him.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

Either way, the ninja seemed to be quite exhausted. <font color=#198aad>&#34; You seem tired. &#34;</font>

Shenza happened to be quite exhausted himself as he was spending the day training his Raiton. As his hands were quite callussed, he shoved them into his robes pockets as he walked closer to the Shinobi<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

So, he thought of the hardest way to train his reflexes and spatial awareness.

Next stop, actual chakra training in order to resist Genjutsu. Or perhaps, ninjutsu?<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

You a ninja too huh? &#34;</font>

I wonder when we&#39;ll need Shinobi again.. It&#39;s been a while since the last war. But that doesn&#39;t mean that it won&#39;t come again, so it&#39;s always smart to remain sharp and prepared both mentally and physically. <font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

Though, I expect to change this soon. I haven&#39;t yet checked what my chakra nature is, but I suspect it will either be fire or earth.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

But what some ninja fail to realize, it isn&#39;t impossible to change it. I struggled with it too... I want to learn Earth as well, I&#39;ve only scratched the surface of Earth chakra though. In time, I believe I&#39;ll break through that barrier of knowledge. &#34;</font> 

<font color=#198aad>&#34; Speaking with the teachers will help a lot... Although there methods of help could be confusing....&#34;</font> &lt;always speaking in riddles...&gt; <font color=#198aad>&#34; I&#39;ve learned lots from them. Maybe you can too someday. &#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
