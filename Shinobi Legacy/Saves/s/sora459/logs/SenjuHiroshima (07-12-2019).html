It was understandable to be angry about it and despite not showing it Hiroshima could feel it bubble under him as well. Believing in a cause that he was raised in but he was able to distinguish himself from his &#39;enemy&#39; in a way. <font color=#15665e>&#34;It is just like Cattle. They raised a wonderful life believing it to be prosperous but only set up for slaughter.&#34;</font> His analogy was brutal but that was they things were. <font color=#15665e>&#34;We&#39;re just the kind gentlemen with the knowledge and power to set them free.&#34;</font> He smirked.

He&#39;d drop forward taking his seat properly, <font color=#15665e>&#34;I mean you can hand a slave the key to their freedom but truly it is the mind that has to be free&#39;d first and then their decision of whether they will stay the course of that life.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 23:34> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>observed the wise teenage soldier as he nodded along, <font color=#ffffff>&#34;we are all different. But in the end, we were all born in this world, trapped in the same cage,&#34;</font> Adateus said. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;There is no fate, only the design of the one that began it all. We are players of his game and observe the world through its eyes. The phenomenon we call life, it might as well be nothing,&#34;</font> the soldier said as he observed his singular hand.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;We must live life not to live, but to die knowing that we left a mark on life.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 23:39> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#15665e>Senju, Hiroshima <font color=yellow>had let those words sink in momentarily as he realized he was deeply rooted into the cause for the White Cloak and in the end they were his family in the way he watched after them and they watched after him. He didn&#39;t seem against these words but he never did utter once about him wanting to find out about his family and what had happened to them. That was a journey he was willing to walk on his own to find out. 

<font color=#15665e>&#34;I surely hope to gather much more information about this world before I go.&#34;</font> He said looking up at the ceiling momentarily. He hoped death&#39;s reach was far away from him at this point. <font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 23:45> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>placed his hand upon the shoulder of his friend. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;I&#39;m sure you shall,&#34;</font> he confirmed. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;You are after all special in your own way,&#34;</font> Adateus explained as he began to climb up from the seat. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;If you one day need support, you can always come to this family. This is your home, but not your original one; I understand that above anyone else.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 23:55> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#15665e>Senju, Hiroshima <font color=yellow>smiles as he thought of that as well. He had heard it so many times in the orphanage considering he was always the one to excel but mentally he never thought of himself as much. More or less he only thought of the other orphans safety first being one of the few older ones currently. It did explain why he had began taking his training much more seriously in comparison to the time of his studying.

<font color=#15665e>&#34;Not many do, but I&#39;m glad you understand.&#34;</font> He kept his identity under wrap when he traveled throughout the village and didn&#39;t refer to himself as Hiroshima, but Mugen instead. Why that name? It just belonged to a cool Kenjutsu user that he remembered hearing tales of as a kid. <font color=#15665e>&#34;What about you? What are you goals?&#34;</font> He asked out of curiosity. <font color=#15665e>&#34;I know you take the lead on a lot of our &#39;recruitment&#39; expeditions but I never really ask what really goes through your mind.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/13/2019 00:07> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>thought about the subject a lot. But, he couldn&#39;t simply respond. He closed his eyed and tapped his five fingers on the table. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;I desire... to see the light,&#34;</font> he said &#39;fore he opened his eyes. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;To see bustling streets filled of enriched peasants, to see the marching of soldiers come to an end, to see the leaders inspire and protect their citizens.&#34;</font>

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;..I desire to leave the world a little more fair after my flame disappears from this pyre,&#34;</font> he admitted.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/13/2019 00:11> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#15665e>Senju, Hiroshima <font color=yellow>chuckles lightly as he looks up at the young lady who walk over toward where he was sitting placing a cup with something to drink in it. It was tea, he was going to need a little energy to keep himself active. <font color=#15665e>&#34;A man of the people. I can respect that.&#34;</font> He nodded as he could hear the conviction in his voice. At most all he could think of people like Kato. 

<font color=#15665e>&#34;In that attempt, however, it could very well lead to yet another War.&#34;</font> He said as he took a sip from his cup and then placed it back down. He chose not to look at Adateus when he said such. <font color=#15665e>&#34;It could also mean more blood shed..are you truly ready for something like that?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/13/2019 00:13> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>smiled at his friend, <font color=#ffffff>&#34;bloodshed is the only language that humans speak, that much has been proven in our history as this organisation,&#34;</font> he said. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;If we do not begin the conflict, another shall begin and wipe us out. It&#39;s simple, the first one to punch, is the one that shall be victorious..&#34;</font>

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;Why wouldn&#39;t the good guys be the one to win? Eventually.. they should... they need to.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/13/2019 00:18> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#15665e>Senju, Hiroshima <font color=yellow>did wonder where there any good or bad guys in all of this. War and pain also led to hatred and vengence in this world. This was going to soon become that much more of a problem for everyone. He was right though. Someone was going too throw the first punch and by all means he would protect his people at all cost. Hiro constantly made it clear his dislike for leadership roles to be placed on him, but never did decline the idea of actually taking on a position in the future. It was a lot of pressure and with as much baggage as he carried, he didn&#39;t want his obscure vision of life to ever jeopardize his family.

<font color=#15665e>&#34;A Bleak way of looking at it, but reality is reality. I just hope it is nothing that will carry on like the thirty year war...&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

Often he looked at his freedom to move around above ground as a priveledge. Not many knew who he really was or what his motives were. He kept his intentions hidden at most unless it was with his family back at the institute. Today was like any other day with him trying to perfect his range of dodon techniques so that when it came to combat he would be more effective. His range of abilities were growing of course making him quite formidable for someone of his age.

<font color=#15665e>&#34;Guess I better get to work.&#34;</font> He murmured as he got dressed in his usual attire. After getting himself together the teenager would head down to the training grounds where he would begin to work out diligently. His taijutsu was becoming rather horrid but he managed to make his ninjutsu and ability to use Doton rather effective in its current stage.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

His current motive was to build as much chakra control as he possibly could. This was gong to prove to be a challenge for him as this would be an intense version of his normal training as his goal was to make it up the water fall despite its constant flowing current. He would soon strip of his shirt and shoes leaving him soon in nothing but his underwear. As the pressure began to press down on him he would groan in pain before soon falling from his ascension.

He&#39;d lay in the water just floating for a moment trying to take a break. He could only think about what him and Adateus had discussed the day prior and how important it was for him to get stronger. People like the uchiha were going to be a threat to them if he couldn&#39;t increase his strength. Although he shared a different mindset from his brother/friend. His methods may have to prove a tad bit different. All the same if his enemies through the first punch he would at least need to be able to defend himself.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
