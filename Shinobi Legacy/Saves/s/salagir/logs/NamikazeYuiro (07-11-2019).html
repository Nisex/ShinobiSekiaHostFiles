<big><07/11/2019 21:42> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#b02789>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>// Through the thousands of steps one could take, he did not realize he already arrive at his destination. In the distance, a village once primal stood. Greater than the capital, a sickening, gut-wrenching, terrible fate for the world.

The whitecloak, without fear, headed into enemy territory. The armor plates clanked, the eyes of the ape king&#39;s descendant ran through the domain that was once his emperor&#39;s. What was the truth?

<font color=#b02789>&#34;...There must be a reason,&#34;</font> Adateus of the Kumojin thought as he headed past the food stands.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 21:46> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#00ffcc>Namikaze, Yuiro <font color=yellow>// A loud yawn escaped the Hokages mouth as he turned a corner, on a day he knew nothing of but peace and what seemed like a normal day. He lowered his head for a moment putting his hands to his pockets attempting to blend in, he didn&#39;t want to be noticed, as he was trying to escape the paperwork required of being Hokage, as turned the corner he noticed a strangely dressed man, and he didn&#39;t look any ninja the Hokage had ever met himself, still he walked by him before he heard him mutter a sentence, the Hokage purposely brushed his shoulder softly and then smiled while turning to him.

<font color=#00ffcc>&#34;Oof, sorry. Looking for something?&#34;</font> he asked the man attempting inquire about information<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 21:48> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#b02789>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>// The stranger in silver and crimson clicked his finger. Someone, that could, potentially, be related to his emperor. It seemed at least as he noticed the uniform. <font color=#b02789>&#34;You must be an important figure around here?&#34;</font> He asked.

A question, questioned.

A similar technique used by the spies of the whitecloaks. No questions would be answered here on his side, this conversation would only play by his rules.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 21:55> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#00ffcc>Namikaze, Yuiro <font color=yellow>chuckled a bit scratching the back of his head looking at the strangely dressed fellow, he was thinking to himself he didn&#39;t want to cause any damage to the surronding the area so attempting to bring down this intruder was not a good idea. While the white cloaked man was attempting to play by his own rules, he had only given the Hokage the information that he need. These were jounin clothes, and any ninja or even citizen of the leaf would know who he was, he knew this was an outsider, and not just any visitor as they&#39;d most likely would&#39;ve done their research.

<font color=#00ffcc>&#34;I believe I ask you first sir, but I&#39;ll tell you, me I&#39;m just a lowly ninja of the leaf ninja...&#34;</font> he said laughing again this time in a darker tone his eyes solely focused on the man infront of him.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

It seemed that the teenage soldier didn&#39;t hold back, even against the leader of a domain. For after all, he felt invincible in the name of his emperor.

<font color=#b02789>&#34;What is your name, first of all?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<font color=#00ffcc>&#34;I don&#39;t think you should step any closer...&#34;</font> he said peering at him, Yuiro was ready to unleash an attack now, he just need to wait for the right moment.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/11/2019 22:33> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#b02789>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>took his right hand and placed the side upon his other arm. Closing his eyes, he&#39;d pray to the emperor &#39;fore a huge chop of the right ripped the arm to shreds. It plummeted against the concrete. Blood did splatter all over the ground and over the white robe.

With a strained voice, he&#39;d look on into the lord&#39;s eyes. <font color=#b02789>&#34;My father always taught me that a man can only hope to change everything in this world when a sacrifice is made.. I want our sides to understand each other above all.. We could find out the truth together, yet we fight because our fathers and grandfathers did..&#34;</font>

<font color=#b02789>&#34;Why must people die because of our ignorance, Yuiro?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 22:36> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#00ffcc>Namikaze, Yuiro <font color=yellow>// <font color=#00ffcc>&#34;Wai-wai!&#34;</font> he tried to scream, but wasn&#39;t able to say it in time as blood spilled the ground of the Konoha, he looked down as the blood poured from where his arm used to be, he went from looking at it to his eyes over and over again. This guy was a special type of insane, if he was willing to take his completely off for this cause, then perhaps it was real. But what if it was all a lie, or what if he fell into genjutsu, many thoughts went through the Hokages head, there wasn&#39;t a look a of fear, but just horrorified confusion, he spoke a single word.

<font color=#00ffcc>&#34;Speak...&#34;</font> he said<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 22:48> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#b02789>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>fell upon his knees due to the blood loss, but the head of the schwarzmantel did not falter. His eyes looked on into the cosmos, the blue aether coveted by rulers to traverse. No one could ever touch the stars, no one even thought of the possibilities beyond the scope.

It seemed.. peaceful to be insignificant.

Adateus spoke then, <font color=#b02789>&#34;our cause is to be born, solely to die. Our blood is not special, thousands perish under a pretentious conflict for temporal territory. All of this, it had been built under the orders of an emperor, but most of all, a brother of the land. He treated his soldiers as if they were of his blood. But, his council existed of the greediest fools..&#34;</font>

Tears began to stream from the eyes of the soldier as he would continue to tell his father&#39;s tale, <font color=#b02789>&#34;my father only survived because of the emperor. The emperor invented the orphanage and took in victims of the first world war. My father did continue that trend, Weiﬂmantel is just an orphanage. I too, am an orphan..&#34;</font>

<font color=#b02789>&#34;..But we will die so that one day, there will be no need for orphanages anymore. Just as the emperor was betrayed by those closest to him, solely for territory. That shall happen again, and again, and again!.. It almost seems pointless, the pain of the emperor, his valiant efforts to unite the land, only to be slandered.&#34;</font>

<font color=#b02789>&#34;Now.. everybody believes he is a tyrant. But, he abolished executions and slavery. He is the reason my clan isn&#39;t in shackles merely because of their strange bodily features. We live to die, so that others don&#39;t have to. That world war, it&#39;s coming, just like it happened that day..&#34;</font>

<font color=#b02789>&#34;The same day the emperor embraced that traitor as his own brother and told him to always come to him if there were any issues, he was usurped and tortured. I will not rest until his dream is fulfilled. I will die just as my father did. Because no human can change this world, unless they sacrifice everything they have.&#34;</font>

<font color=#b02789>&#34;..Now you can execute me. I am merely a messenger.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 22:55> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#00ffcc>Namikaze, Yuiro <font color=yellow>// was brought almost brought to the tears by the man spilling his emotions, it made him feel bad, this man had cut off his arm off just to get this point across to him and told him of traitor in one of the four domains, he sighed a deep sigh looking at him, he clasped his hands togther.

<font color=#00ffcc>&#34;I don&#39;t know you, and I will not lie...I do not trust you, but if you&#39;re willing to cut your own arm off and sacrafice your life for this cause I will look into, however I will not spare your life.&#34;</font> he said performing handseals as his arms began fill an electric shock, and they began to glow as he held them outward

<font color=#00ffcc>&#34;Perhaps you will your father in the next life and if your story if true you will have just prevented a war, because I now will take it upon myself to destroy this traitor and kill him myself, preventing this war and keeping the peace of the four domains and if you are telling you the truth I will gather your orphange and they will be welcome here.&#34;</font> he said as a glowing ring formed in front of hands 

<font color=#00ffcc>&#34;Storm Release: Laser Circus..&#34;</font> he said as he a hail of powerful electric bullets flew at the whitecloaked intruder and Yuiro intend on completely disintergrating him.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 23:05> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#b02789>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>closed his eyes &#39;fore he heard his father&#39;s voice once more, <font color=#b02789>&#34;you shall not rest until the deed is done.&#34;</font> Then and there, he heaved his vessel up and shouted, <font color=#b02789>&#34;I shall not die in vain! I have something else to do before you execute me!&#34;</font> The disarmed soldier said.

In a singular step, he rushed to the exit and tried his best to escape the grasp of this lord. It seemed a tough match. In fact, almost impossible. But he had to return to the orphanage to begin his search for the emperor&#39;s skull. That was the deed he had to do for his father.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
