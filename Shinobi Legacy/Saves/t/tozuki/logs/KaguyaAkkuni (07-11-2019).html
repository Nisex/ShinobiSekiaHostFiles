The kid inserts a few ryo into the machine and presses one of the buttons. Afterwards, he would pick up the drink he bought, sit on the nearest bench and proceed to drink in silence.The sound ninja has a headband attached to his ninja bag, so it&#39;s easy to tell where he came from.

<big><07/11/2019 13:07> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#329aa9>Rain Ninja <font color=yellow>turned his gaze over to the Ninja in unfamiliar clothing. Now he didn&#39;t say anything at first as he was just calmly minding his own for the time being, and enjoying a lightl meal with a bottle of water. <font color=#329aa9>&#34;Your clothes are weird.&#34;</font> he finally spoke breaking the silence before drinking a bit of water.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 13:15> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#c161bd>Kaguya, Akkuni <font color=yellow>turned around a few times, looking for the person the amegakure shinobi was talking to. When he finally realized no one is around, he spoke. <font color=#c161bd>&#34;M..me...? What is wrong with my attire? I don&#39;t understand...&#34;</font> The young ninja decided to inspect his clothes, but he couldn&#39;t figure out what&#39;s weird about them.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 13:26> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#329aa9>Rain Ninja <font color=yellow>waited a bit to respond before he simply responded, later. <font color=#329aa9>&#34;Uhh I never said there was anything wrong with it.&#34;</font> he said bluntly before finally capping the bottle of water.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 13:37> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>The village that rested before him seemed to be clouded by fog. Tall buildings and bridges were hidden by the fog that surrounded it. Overtaken by curiousity the ninja ventures in, oblivious as to what he may find. A sign stood tall in front of him which read: Amegakure. He squinted his eyes as he made his way through the mist, walking slowly as his hair soon became damp due to the rain. As he went further into the village, he saw twin doors that seemed to have light creeping from under them. &lt; So it isn&#39;t empty... &gt; He slowly walked towards the doors.

Pushing them open as he poked his head through, there seemed to be two ninja sitting on the chairs of the building. One who he recognized slightly, only seeing him pass by in his home village. That put him at ease for a while as he walked inside. He gave a nod to both of the ninja as he continued to walk inside. <font color=#198aad>&#34; Am I interrupting something? &#34;</font> The aura of the room was moreso calm so he felt welcomed as he sat on one of the chairs in the room.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 13:53> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#c161bd>Kaguya, Akkuni <font color=yellow>scratched his head, because the stranger said his clothes are weird, but now said that there&#39;s nothing wrong with them,
 
<font color=#c161bd>&#34;&lt;How were they weird then?&gt;&#34;</font> he thought. 

The kid decided to drop this topic, since he couldn&#39;t understand the other guy, and moved onto a new one.

<font color=#c161bd>&#34;So..this is a really nice village, but it&#39;s probably even more quiet than otogakure, so many buildings, yet it&#39;s silent-- Actually...that&#39;s a good thing, and any place is better than my village...because the hidden sound village reminds me of......nevermind.&#34;</font> 

The young shinobi would stand up and throw the bottle he emptied into a trash can. He would ignore the fellow otogakure ninja.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/11/2019 14:06> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#329aa9>Rain Ninja <font color=yellow>looked around the village after they commented on it. He didn&#39;t have that many fond memories of it. well he did, but tha&#39;ts neither here nor there it felt as he moved his hand over to unstrap the weeapon from his shoulders to pat his shoulders a bit after he set the large blade against his side. <font color=#329aa9>&#34;Ow..&#34;</font> He said as he massaged himself a few more times ebfore he eventually sighed.

<font color=#329aa9>&#34;It&#39;s..okay.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/11/2019 14:21> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>Seeing as though he&#39;s been ignored he decides to relax and listen in. The conversation was rather odd as he couldn&#39;t really grab the main topic of it. Something about the village? <font color=#198aad>&#34; What happened to your shoulder? Or is it just sore from that huge sword on your back. &#34;</font> 

The ninja seemed to be able to lift it up easily, maybe strong in taijustu? The headband on the ninjas forehead suggested that he was of the rain village. After all, this was the rain village so that&#39;s to be expected. On the other hand, he did wonder why a ninja from his own village would be here. Could it be similar to his own reasoning?<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 14:38> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#990033>Rain Ninja <font color=yellow>shook his head briefly to the queston. <font color=#990033>&#34;I&#39;m used to to the weight of the sword, I have to be since it&#39;s my weapon of choice, the weight can be an issue, at times.&#34;</font> He nodded to himself a bit as he sighed patting his arm a bit. When he was thinking about it he didn&#39;t seem to have done anything to it? Maybe it&#39;s just from sleeping on ti wrong.

<font color=#990033>&#34;I think I&#39;ll be fine. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s form the weight...at least I hope not.&#34;</font> The pain seemed to be easing slightly, but it wasa still there, he just wanted to take a small break from having his weapon strapped to his shoulders for a bit. He still sighed a bit as he rubbed the  nape of his neck, there were two Ninjas from Otogakure it seemed. He did immidately assume something was going to happen, but, nothing of yet as occured, for now at least.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 04:23> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#c161bd>Kaguya, Akkuni <font color=yellow>decided to stop focusing on the bad memories and started training his Shikotsumyaku kekkei genkai. His O+ blood already gave him a good headstart, since people with this blood type have higher bone density than people with other types. He decided to visit a dojo to learn how to manipulate his bones properly and increase the bone density even more. He spent a few hours hitting the logs with his bones, breaking countless amounts of them in the process. When he was done with this activity, he decided to practice his combat dancing techniques.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/12/2019 05:26> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#c161bd>Kaguya, Akkuni <font color=yellow>was too tired to keep going, so he called it a day. The young shinobi tried to forget about these bad memories, but they kept coming back..He sat down on a bench and succumbed to the dark emotions. He closed his eyes and started seeing flashbacks of that day....


It was October the 10th of year 137, it was a rainy day. Akkuni was 9 years old, he was living with his grandparents, they adopted him after his parents died in the last year of the war, when he was only two. He didn&#39;t really remember them, he was too young.

 The child was returning from a ramen restaurant with his grandpa and grandma in the evening, it was raining heavily. The streets were empty. While walking next to an alley, they heard screaming for help. They decided to take a look, and told Akkuni to stay behind. He didn&#39;t listen, decided to get closer, and watched while hiding behind a garbage container.

He saw a group of middle aged shinobi beating up a teenager, some of them had kunai in their hands. Akkuni&#39;s grandpa asked what&#39;s going on, and told them to leave him alone. The group of ninja turned around, and one of them explained the situation to the old man. They were &#39;teaching him a lesson&#39; for refusing to rob a traveller from the hidden leaf. They still held a grudge to the other villages, even though the war ended. One of the shinobi finished off the teenager, which was a step too far to his grandpa. 

He prepared for combat by assuming the <font color=#c161bd>&#34;Dance of the Larch&#34;</font>, a technique giving almost absolute defense against taijutsu, and the ability to fight multiple opponents at once.

The old man was spinning around and killing the bandits with ease, that was until a kunai with an explosive tag was thrown from behind the back of Akkuni out of nowhere. The tag was detonated right in front of Akkuni&#39;s grandpa, which killed him instantly. His grandma was watching from behind, so she was just knocked unconscious, but...she was still finished off by one of them afterwards. 

When Akkuni realized what happened, he decided to turn around.
Behind him stood a few more thugs, who came to their friends&#39; rescue. One of them grabbed Akkuni&#39;s hair and started punching him in the face. Afterwards he threw him into the wall, and let the rest finish the job. They started kicking him, punching him, spitting on him, and eventually stabbed him with a kunai.

Shortly after they got bored and ran away from the scene, someone spotted him, picked him up from the ground and transported to the hospital. Normally, he would be dead, but his instincts made him create a layer of bone underneath his skin, which saved him from fatal injuries. A few days later, Akkuni was discharged from the hospital, but the problem was, he had nowhere to go.

Since that day, he spent as much time as possible in the hospital, because it was the only place where people cared about others, the only place where he felt safe. One of the nurses brought him food every day, and taught him the basics of medical jutsu. The child developed an interest in the medical jutsu, and wanted to help other people, but at the same time, he despised the ninja world, and wanted to get rid of shinobi altogether. These two things conflicted with eachother, because almost every person in the world was a shinobi at this point, but he didn&#39;t want to see any more violence. He knew there was no way to get rid of them, the world was spoiled to it&#39;s roots, but he wanted to believe, that there is a way to stop the violence by spreading love and support.

This conflict made him develop two distinct personalities, who kept arguing with eachother inside of his head, and still do to this day.

<big><07/12/2019 13:12> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>snaps out of his daze, and looks around him. Seems like Shenza and that other shonobi went their seperate ways. Now it was just kato, some fellow he hadn&#39;t seen before, and....some weird guy dressed in strange clothing?

Asahi found him to be oddbut there was bound to be a few weird individuals within the big world they inhabited. Thus, he shrugged it off, and walked towards the wall behind Kato and proceeded to lean on it.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Still reading?&#34;</font>, he asked with a light smile before waving towards the Other Sound Ninja.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:14> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>nodded as Kato handed him some water aswell.However, he completely disregarded what he said and drank it in one gulp! The Namikaze let out a refreshing &#39;ahh&#39; and laid back on the bench.

<font color=#94ad8c>&#34;So Kato-san? Cool.&#34;</font>He said casually whilst giving him a firm handshake.With that out of the way, he turned his focus towards the other shinobi leaning against the wall <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;I was wondering when you&#39;d stop staring out into space like that.&#34;</font>He chuckled.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:14> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>|| Throughout his journey into the truth he traversed amongst the domains. His emperor had built them, but it seemed everybody did forget of his deeds. All that they could remember today? Slander of usurpers, unrighteous inheritors to the throne of a being beyond mankind.

The schwarzmantel stepped into another enemy domain. Otogakure, the land of plains. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;So close to home, yet so far from the truth,&#34;</font> the soldier said. It seemed he missed one arm, a scar from battle?<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:19> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>watched as a strangely dressed person walked onto the scene.With buldging eyes, Zoku, stared at him with wonder! THE FASHION THESE DAYS! OUTRAGEOUS!

Calming himself down, he focused on the guy and noticed several things about him.The first thing he noticed was obviously the big kite-like thing he was wearing, but the most eye-catching was his missing arm...

<font color=#94ad8c>&#34;So.....Stranger-san......where do you hail from then?&#34;</font>He asked<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:21> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>pivoted his head to meet the gaze of the newcomer from his peripherals as he spoke. As Asahi continued to gaze and assess him, he noticed that one of the sleeves was just dangling and seemed to move with the breeze. was he missing an arm? or is it just within his clothing. Whatever the case, what he said was weird. What did he mean by &#39;so far from the truth&#39;? This thought lingered inside inside Asahi&#39;s mind like a never ending carousel.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;The Sound is your home?&#34;</font>, the lad inquired. <font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I haven&#39;t seen you around here before. Parhaps you&#39;re a shinobi returning from duty?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:24> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>stopped in one&#39;s steps &#39;fore he rotated his neck to face those that addressed him. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Where do you hail from then?&#34;</font> He repeated. Then, he traced his steps back to stand before the strangers. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Weiﬂmantel,&#34;</font> he admitted. The ancient order was but a mere conspiracy, removed repeatedly from historical records.

But, that&#39;d explain his strange fashion sense, for the ancient order wore intricate robes of ivory and silver.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:29> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>rose up from his laid-back position, his elbows on his knees as he placed his face onto his hands, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Weelmantel? Sounds ancient....&#34;</font>He told him.The young Namikaze sighed as he watched the one-armed man just stand there.

Zoku smiled as he patted the seat next to him, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Well now im interested! Come sit and tell us about WEELMANTEL!&#34;</font>He told him.It wasnt that he was nosy or anything, its just......was there anything better to do right now?<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:31> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>squinted, as the Stranger answered the fellow Sound Ninja&#39;s question. Weiﬂmantel? What was that. Asahi had never heard such a weird sounding phrase before. The mention of that phrase made the young lad suspicious, but yet, at the same time, he was intrigued. Could this Weiﬂmantel thing be related to the truth he was talking about?

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I&#39;m sorry?&#34;</font>, Asahi said as he rose his body from up again the wall, and walked around the bench to get a better view of the Stranger. <font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve never heard of such a town or nation. What might that be?&#34;</font> he inquired.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:35> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0x0]><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja says, "Am I intruding?"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:36> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>reached for the bench. Each step, carried a heave of destruction, plummeting the concrete beneath the black sandals. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Weiﬂmantel is the ancient order constructed by the early emperor&#39;s advisor. Kanar created an orphanage and trained them into soldiers that kept the order,&#34;</font> he revealed as he stepped forth to the bench.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;Naturally, governments began to hunt us,&#34;</font> he continued on. It then became clear that this teenage soldier could also be an enemy to the government of this here domain, but that did not seem to bother the veteran child. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;It is a saddening fact that even you did not hear of the Weiﬂmantel that stopped the second world war.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:42> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>raised a brow at the unknown Shinobi, he zoned out what he was saying before. Being lost, he closed his book to see what did this person want. Closing the book, the crimson eyes turned into a dull red color. Clearing his throat.

<font color=#666699>&#34;Did you want something?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:43> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>could see the damage this unknown shinobi was causing to the street, but what was he supposed to do about it? At first he took it as a sign of hostility, but soon displaced that theory when the weelmantel shinobi began to tell his story.

Zoku grimaced, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Hmm....Well I wont say that I believe you in that regards as I&#39;ve NEVER heard of your organization at all.....especially when if they were that important in the war, how could NO one know about them?&#34;</font>He stated plainly<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:46> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>| | The Uchiha&#39;s eyes widens, as he proceeded to leap back to a comfortable distance in response to not only the stranger&#39;s advancement or the very pavement giving in to the overwhelming pressure he was exerting, but rather the mention of Weiﬂmantel being related to the term &#39;Emperor&#39;. Though the world has known a brief time of peace and the newer generation had been sheltered from the past atrocities that were comitted during the war, stories and rumors have been spread down as time continued to pass, so Asahi knew that this Stranger was more or less dangerous, if not highly suspicious.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Why would someone in a group that was formed by the emperor&#39;s deceased advisor be here now of all times and places?&#34;</font>, Asahi asked as sweat rolled down the side of his face.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:51> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#d42780>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>flicked a lighter, letting the calm flames graze his cigarette. He would clip the lighter, closing it and depositing it back into his pockets. An index and middle finger would lace the outer material, giving way for smoke to exit from the tubular shape. 

Slowly, the same fingers would bring the cigarette down a little, so he could exhale. Seemed a scene had been boiling for what could have been some time. There were familiar clothes, but not familiar faces. Nevertheless, His take on the situation was as any comparable to his younger days. The cigaratte would take itself back to his lips, puffing again.

<font color=#d42780>&#34;Seems like I&#39;m late to the party. Whats wrong?&#34;</font> His pupils locked onto the most interesting figure, and as a response, they dilated. His fingers widened, the thin shaped cylinder dropping to the floor.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/12/2019 14:13> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>chuckled at the ignorance, but he couldn&#39;t blame anyone. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Your government has lied to you,&#34;</font> he said, in pain and in grace, he rose his hand to the cosmos and made a fist. Blossoms did release from trees, like blood from the veins. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Schwarzmantel of the Weiﬂmantel. I do not belong in any domain, even though the emperor constructed them,&#34;</font> the messenger said.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;My duty as the blackcloak is simple, freund. I simply deliver the truth and sacrifice all that is necessary. I, a mere orphan, was accepted and taught as if family. That is the least I could do.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:20> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>placed his face back onto his hands and let out a whistling noise, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;So basically....You&#39;re like a a remainant soldier from this organization named Welmantel and my government-well the current government has tracked you all down and is trying to demolish any information about you guys and your deeds?&#34;</font>He stated as a recap to what he was saying.

The reason he did so, was to help him process it all.It wasnt as though what he was saying was complicated or shocking, but it just didn&#39;t make sense to him.Why would the government want to discredit those that helped stop a war? 

Although that was a valid question, Zoku, wasn&#39;t the type to address something unless he felt absolutely necessary.So he decided to just nod and watch the unknown shinobi&#39;s mannerism...This guy was just too suspicious!<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

He rised up off of the bench, Kato placed his hand on his chin. Absorbing all of the information that this &#39;shinobi&#39; was giving him, he had some questions for the shinobi.

<font color=#666699>&#34;So. . What did the &#39;government&#39; lie about?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/12/2019 14:31> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>stepped forth as the mantle danced upon the breeze. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Silence, that is the sound of your government,&#34;</font> he said as he pointed at the soldiers. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Isan delivered the end to his opponents, but for some odd reason, the sons and daughters of these leaders began to lead once more. The council hid information, solely to besmirch the emperor once more.&#34;</font>

A sigh rose from one&#39;s lips, <font color=#ffffff>&#34;there is soon to be a conflict once more. Weiﬂmantel sent me to find those responsible, to spread the message and to inform as many as possible. Weiﬂmantel was formed as an order to stop innocent bloodshed, but this road once more leads to just that.&#34;</font>

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;A third world war where many sacrifices will have to be made..&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:39> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>was taken aback as watched the unknown shinobi.The way the man was speaking was if his organization was going to cause a third war? Zoku grimaced, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;I can understand-no I cant understand what your organizations has been through, but from what you&#39;re saying.....It sounds like you guys want a war? I aint down with that.&#34;</font>He announced.

<font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Im not for the government or against it...I am a shinobi, so i just follow orders, but id never be for something that wants war...ever,so I hope you aren&#39;t trying to  do this...&#34;</font>Zoku would then pull out a kunai.

What was this rookie shino<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/12/2019 14:41> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>lowers his eyelid, as he motions towards the back of his hit, and placed his hand on top of his Kunai holster just encase the worse case situation were to happen.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;The past is the past. All we can do is to look at what our previous mistakes have done to the Shinodi world without dwelling on it, for that wouldn&#39;t help us in todat&#39;s present.&#34;</font>, Asahi began to say.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;There is bound to be conflict once more, but unlike what happened in the war years ago I will ensure that the Sound be prepared for it, so no sacrifices are casualties are to happen. I don&#39;t know if what you&#39;re saying about the Government is true or not, nor do i have the means to verify it. However, if that&#39;s what it takes to bring about a longer time of peace, then I wouldn&#39;t mind those who they govern to remain ignorant to the truth.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:46> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>would listen in as he propped his foot up on the wall.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:51> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>grinned in delight &#39;fore he held open his hand. Then, a hundred spiders began to climb from the gap of the grin. Each spider had a name, each an individual, prepared to give in their flame for the truth. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;We do not desire bloodshed, ,&#34;</font> the blackcloak stated &#39;fore he placed a finger underneath his eyelid.

Then, a crimson spider began to climb from the slit. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Shin,&#34;</font> he called the spider, once he looked on at the soldiers of the enemy domain. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;We were put here on this earth to feel nothing but pain,&#34;</font> he said to the spider.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;I&#39;ve seen many ignore the truth solely to protect their circle, but, the truth cannot be forgotten. The web we weaved in the past shall catch those flies that spread their lies. Do you know what spiders have in common with humans?&#34;</font> He questioned those before him.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;They devour each other.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:51> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>pulled out an apple and begins to peel the skin with the kunai, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Not that I can do anything about right now.&#34;</font>He said.The young Namikaze would then began to whistle as he dwindled away the foreskin of the apple.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/12/2019 15:19> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#c161bd>Kaguya, Akkuni <font color=yellow>was just eavesdropping on the dialogue, up until now. When he heard, that the strange man just challenged them to a battle in order to see if they are prepared for battle, he approached the group and stopped next to the bench.

The young genin really hated the word <font color=#c161bd>&#34;war&#34;</font>, since it took his entire family from him, and he really hoped that it&#39;s possible to avoid another one....Sadly it was highely unlikely, so the best move would be accepting the challenge, and finding out about his combat capabilities before it&#39;s too late.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:20> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc000492]><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja says, "Fighting huh?"</font></font><br></big>

<big><07/12/2019 15:26> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>sighed in the most exaggerated manner possible. The spiders began to flood over the ground, as they seemed to talk to their father. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;We&#39;ve fought many times before in our previous lives. Araneus fought here, too. Toga did fight here, against the infamous usurper emperor; Tozuki Iwazuka..&#34;</font>

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;I, Kumojin, Adateus shall take their mantle of sacrifice. My intention is not bloodshed, but true peace under the return of the emperor. If you desire, you can join me and find out the truth for yourself, or you can keep being fooled by your government, used as livestock to keep their power afloat.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:28> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc000492]><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja says, "Either way, still gonna be fighting."</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:33> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#9966ff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>returned to their favorite spot in the village and watched a sermon from a man who has an audience of spiders as well as Otogakure natives. There was disinterest in their demeanor to the whole speech.

In fact, Stitch settles for reclining on the rooftop of the wall, awaiting for at least Kato&#39;s opinion on it.

<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:35> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>squints, as a horde of spiders were summoned forth from the Strange Man. he leaps back, and draws out a Kunai. Even though he was supposedly &#39;testing&#39; them, perhaps this may have been too much for a bunch of genin to fight off.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I don&#39;t mind if the Government continues to deceive the people they have governed, for it has continuously brought us peace, and for once a time of prosperity. Engaging in conflict with the Emperor once more would only serve to reenact the past atrocities commited, for the Emperor himself was also willing to make sacrifices, no matter what it may have been. And look where that got him. For those reasons, I&#39;ll have to decline your offer, as much as a fool it would make me.&#34;</font>, the lad concluded, as he placed a firm grip on his Kunai.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Those are just my feelings, however. I am unable to speak for anyone else.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:37> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc000492]><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja says, "aint we suppoed to scrap lol"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:37> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>looked at the spiders , they were growing in numbers. All he wanted to do is train, but he was stopped by these spiders and Shinobi. He didn&#39;t care for the speech or anything, it was pointless to him. He thought it was just a person trying to convince him for something stupid. Kato reached down to his kunai holster, thinking this can be some time of training for him.

<font color=#666699>&#34;Look, listen, I don&#39;t care for this.&#34;</font> His set his target on the spiders other then the Man who created them.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:48> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>observed the fools that desired to be fooled. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Indeed, &#39;tis as history said,&#34;</font> the lord of arachnae spoke. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;There is no one interested in justice, justice is a long gone concept,&#34;</font> he announced. The spiders kept climbing from his mouth gap, until the entire street seemed to be covered in ivory constructs of silk.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;One side brings shadow, the other brings light. But in the rushing tide, every human is the same; a stain. They shall inevitably choose for disorder, instead of order. You and your friends are proof of this disorder, a desire to be deceived by those that have committed atrocities, murdered families, ended heroes, destroyed competitors,&#34;</font> the ivory man stated.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;Enough talking. Let us begin this trial, bastard humans, children of the usurper,&#34;</font> he declared &#39;fore his armor plate fell into the ground. The ivory cloak floated in the air as silk wrapped around the entire area, constructing a colosseum of woven webs. Then, he held up his singular arm, screaming into the aether.

The scream ruptured ear drums, as the pale skin of the teenage soldier turned crimson. Pupils turned silver, veins began to bulge.. and then he rushed to chop the throat of his opponents at once as if an executioner.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:57> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>narrowed his gaze upon the Strange Man and his spider companions. Seems like talking was no longer an option, as he was preparing to get things underway. Truthfully, when he said he wanted to &#39;test&#39; the group of genin, Asahi thought that fighting group of people, kids as they may be, would put them at a disadvantage, however, he immediately eliminated that and it were not the Sound ninja who should be weary.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;So be it.&#34;</font>, asahi said, as his eyes shifted into a Crimson hue, one tomoe visible within them. He looked around at the surrounding area, and at the Spiders. It seems each and every one of them were embedded with Chakra, so dealing with them as well as him would be tricky. None the less, Asahi braced himself for what was to come. He was determined to prove to him that the Sound was better off without the truth that he spoke of.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:58> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>Jumps back in response to the &#39; Ivory Mans &#39; assault, <font color=#198aad>&#34; You do realize.. Regardless of which path we take. War or fighting is inevitable, only thing that changes is the opponent. Either way, I can&#39;t just stand here and let this go on, nothin personal. &#34;</font> 

Shenza puts up the tiger handseal while he puts distance between himself and the spiders. Surely, nothing good was going to come of this. If things keep on going this way someone would get hurt. Kill or be killed huh?<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 16:01> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc000492]><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja says, "ooc please :C"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 16:01> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>eye&#39;s became lighter, turning into a crimson color. The boy was confident in killing spiders, they were no different then a Deer or a wild animal in the forest, preparing himself for this &#39;battle&#39; this would be some training for him. With the grip tightened on the kunai, he moved his right hand with haste to collect some shruikens. With his hands now prepared for this.

His adrenaline rush kicked in. With his body tensing up, he was now ready to fight these spiders. Not knowing what this man had in his sleeves.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 16:01> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#c161bd>Kaguya, Akkuni <font color=yellow>performs a quick warm-up exercise prior to the battle and assumes the combat dance stance of the Larch, preparing for it.

His first move would be an attempt to kill all the spiders in a single motion. Afterwards, he would join the rest in an attempt to defeat the stranger. The young Kaguya would utilize the Larch dance for the most part of the battle, but there&#39;s a chance that he would use the Camellia dance if the fight was too easy, or chakra scalpels if he was pushed to his limits. He wasn&#39;t exactly fond of fighting, so he would try his best to bring an end to the conflict as soon as possible.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
