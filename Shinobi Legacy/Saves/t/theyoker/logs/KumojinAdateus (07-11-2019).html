<big><07/11/2019 21:42> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#b02789>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>// Through the thousands of steps one could take, he did not realize he already arrive at his destination. In the distance, a village once primal stood. Greater than the capital, a sickening, gut-wrenching, terrible fate for the world.

The whitecloak, without fear, headed into enemy territory. The armor plates clanked, the eyes of the ape king&#39;s descendant ran through the domain that was once his emperor&#39;s. What was the truth?

<font color=#b02789>&#34;...There must be a reason,&#34;</font> Adateus of the Kumojin thought as he headed past the food stands.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 21:46> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#00ffcc>Leaf Ninja <font color=yellow>// A loud yawn escaped the Hokages mouth as he turned a corner, on a day he knew nothing of but peace and what seemed like a normal day. He lowered his head for a moment putting his hands to his pockets attempting to blend in, he didn&#39;t want to be noticed, as he was trying to escape the paperwork required of being Hokage, as turned the corner he noticed a strangely dressed man, and he didn&#39;t look any ninja the Hokage had ever met himself, still he walked by him before he heard him mutter a sentence, the Hokage purposely brushed his shoulder softly and then smiled while turning to him.

<font color=#00ffcc>&#34;Oof, sorry. Looking for something?&#34;</font> he asked the man attempting inquire about information<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 21:48> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#b02789>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>// The stranger in silver and crimson clicked his finger. Someone, that could, potentially, be related to his emperor. It seemed at least as he noticed the uniform. <font color=#b02789>&#34;You must be an important figure around here?&#34;</font> He asked.

A question, questioned.

A similar technique used by the spies of the whitecloaks. No questions would be answered here on his side, this conversation would only play by his rules.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 21:55> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#00ffcc>Leaf Ninja <font color=yellow>chuckled a bit scratching the back of his head looking at the strangely dressed fellow, he was thinking to himself he didn&#39;t want to cause any damage to the surronding the area so attempting to bring down this intruder was not a good idea. While the white cloaked man was attempting to play by his own rules, he had only given the Hokage the information that he need. These were jounin clothes, and any ninja or even citizen of the leaf would know who he was, he knew this was an outsider, and not just any visitor as they&#39;d most likely would&#39;ve done their research.

<font color=#00ffcc>&#34;I believe I ask you first sir, but I&#39;ll tell you, me I&#39;m just a lowly ninja of the leaf ninja...&#34;</font> he said laughing again this time in a darker tone his eyes solely focused on the man infront of him.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 22:00> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#b02789>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>stepped forth to the lord of the forest &#39;fore he held up a singular hand. <font color=#b02789>&#34;Whitecloaks have come with a proposal for the lord,&#34;</font> he said in reaction to the lie. It seemed that the teenage soldier didn&#39;t hold back, even against the leader of a domain. For after all, he felt invincible in the name of his emperor.

<font color=#b02789>&#34;What is your name, first of all?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 22:02> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#00ffcc>Leaf Ninja <font color=yellow><font color=#00ffcc>&#34;I&#39;m Haruno, Kachun.&#34;</font> he said looking across at the ninja, with a confused look on his face, he had no idea what village this guy was from or who the hell the white cloaks were, as he took a step forward Yuiro would have to be on his guard now.

<font color=#00ffcc>&#34;I don&#39;t think you should step any closer...&#34;</font> he said peering at him, Yuiro was ready to unleash an attack now, he just need to wait for the right moment.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

Closing his eyes, he&#39;d pray to the emperor &#39;fore a huge chop of the right ripped the arm to shreds. It plummeted against the concrete. Blood did splatter all over the ground and over the white robe.

With a strained voice, he&#39;d look on into the lord&#39;s eyes. <font color=#b02789>&#34;My father always taught me that a man can only hope to change everything in this world when a sacrifice is made.. I want our sides to understand each other above all.. We could find out the truth together, yet we fight because our fathers and grandfathers did..&#34;</font>

<font color=#b02789>&#34;Why must people die because of our ignorance, Yuiro?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 22:36> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#00ffcc>Namikaze, Yuiro <font color=yellow>// <font color=#00ffcc>&#34;Wai-wai!&#34;</font> he tried to scream, but wasn&#39;t able to say it in time as blood spilled the ground of the Konoha, he looked down as the blood poured from where his arm used to be, he went from looking at it to his eyes over and over again. This guy was a special type of insane, if he was willing to take his completely off for this cause, then perhaps it was real. But what if it was all a lie, or what if he fell into genjutsu, many thoughts went through the Hokages head, there wasn&#39;t a look a of fear, but just horrorified confusion, he spoke a single word.

<font color=#00ffcc>&#34;Speak...&#34;</font> he said<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 22:48> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#b02789>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>fell upon his knees due to the blood loss, but the head of the schwarzmantel did not falter. His eyes looked on into the cosmos, the blue aether coveted by rulers to traverse. No one could ever touch the stars, no one even thought of the possibilities beyond the scope.

It seemed.. peaceful to be insignificant.

Adateus spoke then, <font color=#b02789>&#34;our cause is to be born, solely to die. Our blood is not special, thousands perish under a pretentious conflict for temporal territory. All of this, it had been built under the orders of an emperor, but most of all, a brother of the land. He treated his soldiers as if they were of his blood. But, his council existed of the greediest fools..&#34;</font>

Tears began to stream from the eyes of the soldier as he would continue to tell his father&#39;s tale, <font color=#b02789>&#34;my father only survived because of the emperor. The emperor invented the orphanage and took in victims of the first world war. My father did continue that trend, Weiﬂmantel is just an orphanage. I too, am an orphan..&#34;</font>

<font color=#b02789>&#34;..But we will die so that one day, there will be no need for orphanages anymore. Just as the emperor was betrayed by those closest to him, solely for territory. That shall happen again, and again, and again!.. It almost seems pointless, the pain of the emperor, his valiant efforts to unite the land, only to be slandered.&#34;</font>

<font color=#b02789>&#34;Now.. everybody believes he is a tyrant. But, he abolished executions and slavery. He is the reason my clan isn&#39;t in shackles merely because of their strange bodily features. We live to die, so that others don&#39;t have to. That world war, it&#39;s coming, just like it happened that day..&#34;</font>

<font color=#b02789>&#34;The same day the emperor embraced that traitor as his own brother and told him to always come to him if there were any issues, he was usurped and tortured. I will not rest until his dream is fulfilled. I will die just as my father did. Because no human can change this world, unless they sacrifice everything they have.&#34;</font>

<font color=#b02789>&#34;..Now you can execute me. I am merely a messenger.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 22:55> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#00ffcc>Namikaze, Yuiro <font color=yellow>// was brought almost brought to the tears by the man spilling his emotions, it made him feel bad, this man had cut off his arm off just to get this point across to him and told him of traitor in one of the four domains, he sighed a deep sigh looking at him, he clasped his hands togther.

<font color=#00ffcc>&#34;I don&#39;t know you, and I will not lie...I do not trust you, but if you&#39;re willing to cut your own arm off and sacrafice your life for this cause I will look into, however I will not spare your life.&#34;</font> he said performing handseals as his arms began fill an electric shock, and they began to glow as he held them outward

<font color=#00ffcc>&#34;Perhaps you will your father in the next life and if your story if true you will have just prevented a war, because I now will take it upon myself to destroy this traitor and kill him myself, preventing this war and keeping the peace of the four domains and if you are telling you the truth I will gather your orphange and they will be welcome here.&#34;</font> he said as a glowing ring formed in front of hands 

<font color=#00ffcc>&#34;Storm Release: Laser Circus..&#34;</font> he said as he a hail of powerful electric bullets flew at the whitecloaked intruder and Yuiro intend on completely disintergrating him.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 23:05> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#b02789>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>closed his eyes &#39;fore he heard his father&#39;s voice once more, <font color=#b02789>&#34;you shall not rest until the deed is done.&#34;</font> Then and there, he heaved his vessel up and shouted, <font color=#b02789>&#34;I shall not die in vain! I have something else to do before you execute me!&#34;</font> The disarmed soldier said.

In a singular step, he rushed to the exit and tried his best to escape the grasp of this lord. It seemed a tough match. In fact, almost impossible. But he had to return to the orphanage to begin his search for the emperor&#39;s skull. That was the deed he had to do for his father.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:04> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>shrugged his shoulders as he rolled up his sleeves and sat down.The young man smiled, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;I&#39;d appreciate it.&#34;</font>He said whilst grabbing a riceball from the guy.He would then sit on the bench and dig in, a bit of rice crumbs scattering around his mouth as he ate.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:08> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>shook his head, the person next to him couldn&#39;t wait to eat the riceball, fiddiling around in his backpack, he pulled out some water and handed it to him. <font color=#666699>&#34;Here, try not to drink all of it in one gulp. I&#39;m Uchiha, Kato. Pleasure to meet you.&#34;</font> He held out his hand for a formal greet.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:12> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>snaps out of his daze, and looks around him. Seems like Shenza and that other shonobi went their seperate ways. Now it was just kato, some fellow he hadn&#39;t seen before, and....some weird guy dressed in strange clothing?

Asahi found him to be oddbut there was bound to be a few weird individuals within the big world they inhabited. Thus, he shrugged it off, and walked towards the wall behind Kato and proceeded to lean on it.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Still reading?&#34;</font>, he asked with a light smile before waving towards the Other Sound Ninja.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:14> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>nodded as Kato handed him some water aswell.However, he completely disregarded what he said and drank it in one gulp! The Namikaze let out a refreshing &#39;ahh&#39; and laid back on the bench.

<font color=#94ad8c>&#34;So Kato-san? Cool.&#34;</font>He said casually whilst giving him a firm handshake.With that out of the way, he turned his focus towards the other shinobi leaning against the wall <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;I was wondering when you&#39;d stop staring out into space like that.&#34;</font>He chuckled.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

His emperor had built them, but it seemed everybody did forget of his deeds. All that they could remember today? Slander of usurpers, unrighteous inheritors to the throne of a being beyond mankind.

The schwarzmantel stepped into another enemy domain. Otogakure, the land of plains. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;So close to home, yet so far from the truth,&#34;</font> the soldier said. It seemed he missed one arm, a scar from battle?<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:19> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>watched as a strangely dressed person walked onto the scene.With buldging eyes, Zoku, stared at him with wonder! THE FASHION THESE DAYS! OUTRAGEOUS!

Calming himself down, he focused on the guy and noticed several things about him.The first thing he noticed was obviously the big kite-like thing he was wearing, but the most eye-catching was his missing arm...

<font color=#94ad8c>&#34;So.....Stranger-san......where do you hail from then?&#34;</font>He asked<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:21> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>pivoted his head to meet the gaze of the newcomer from his peripherals as he spoke. As Asahi continued to gaze and assess him, he noticed that one of the sleeves was just dangling and seemed to move with the breeze. was he missing an arm? or is it just within his clothing. Whatever the case, what he said was weird. What did he mean by &#39;so far from the truth&#39;? This thought lingered inside inside Asahi&#39;s mind like a never ending carousel.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;The Sound is your home?&#34;</font>, the lad inquired. <font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I haven&#39;t seen you around here before. Parhaps you&#39;re a shinobi returning from duty?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:24> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>stopped in one&#39;s steps &#39;fore he rotated his neck to face those that addressed him. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Where do you hail from then?&#34;</font> He repeated. Then, he traced his steps back to stand before the strangers. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Weiﬂmantel,&#34;</font> he admitted. The ancient order was but a mere conspiracy, removed repeatedly from historical records.

But, that&#39;d explain his strange fashion sense, for the ancient order wore intricate robes of ivory and silver.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:29> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>rose up from his laid-back position, his elbows on his knees as he placed his face onto his hands, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Weelmantel? Sounds ancient....&#34;</font>He told him.The young Namikaze sighed as he watched the one-armed man just stand there.

Zoku smiled as he patted the seat next to him, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Well now im interested! Come sit and tell us about WEELMANTEL!&#34;</font>He told him.It wasnt that he was nosy or anything, its just......was there anything better to do right now?<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:31> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>squinted, as the Stranger answered the fellow Sound Ninja&#39;s question. Weiﬂmantel? What was that. Asahi had never heard such a weird sounding phrase before. The mention of that phrase made the young lad suspicious, but yet, at the same time, he was intrigued. Could this Weiﬂmantel thing be related to the truth he was talking about?

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I&#39;m sorry?&#34;</font>, Asahi said as he rose his body from up again the wall, and walked around the bench to get a better view of the Stranger. <font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve never heard of such a town or nation. What might that be?&#34;</font> he inquired.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

Each step, carried a heave of destruction, plummeting the concrete beneath the black sandals. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Weiﬂmantel is the ancient order constructed by the early emperor&#39;s advisor. Kanar created an orphanage and trained them into soldiers that kept the order,&#34;</font> he revealed as he stepped forth to the bench.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;Naturally, governments began to hunt us,&#34;</font> he continued on. It then became clear that this teenage soldier could also be an enemy to the government of this here domain, but that did not seem to bother the veteran child. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;It is a saddening fact that even you did not hear of the Weiﬂmantel that stopped the second world war.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:42> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>raised a brow at the unknown Shinobi, he zoned out what he was saying before. Being lost, he closed his book to see what did this person want. Closing the book, the crimson eyes turned into a dull red color. Clearing his throat.

<font color=#666699>&#34;Did you want something?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:43> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>could see the damage this unknown shinobi was causing to the street, but what was he supposed to do about it? At first he took it as a sign of hostility, but soon displaced that theory when the weelmantel shinobi began to tell his story.

Zoku grimaced, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Hmm....Well I wont say that I believe you in that regards as I&#39;ve NEVER heard of your organization at all.....especially when if they were that important in the war, how could NO one know about them?&#34;</font>He stated plainly<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:46> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>| | The Uchiha&#39;s eyes widens, as he proceeded to leap back to a comfortable distance in response to not only the stranger&#39;s advancement or the very pavement giving in to the overwhelming pressure he was exerting, but rather the mention of Weiﬂmantel being related to the term &#39;Emperor&#39;. Though the world has known a brief time of peace and the newer generation had been sheltered from the past atrocities that were comitted during the war, stories and rumors have been spread down as time continued to pass, so Asahi knew that this Stranger was more or less dangerous, if not highly suspicious.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Why would someone in a group that was formed by the emperor&#39;s deceased advisor be here now of all times and places?&#34;</font>, Asahi asked as sweat rolled down the side of his face.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

He would clip the lighter, closing it and depositing it back into his pockets. An index and middle finger would lace the outer material, giving way for smoke to exit from the tubular shape. 

Slowly, the same fingers would bring the cigarette down a little, so he could exhale. Seemed a scene had been boiling for what could have been some time. There were familiar clothes, but not familiar faces. Nevertheless, His take on the situation was as any comparable to his younger days. The cigaratte would take itself back to his lips, puffing again.

<font color=#d42780>&#34;Seems like I&#39;m late to the party. Whats wrong?&#34;</font> His pupils locked onto the most interesting figure, and as a response, they dilated. His fingers widened, the thin shaped cylinder dropping to the floor.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/12/2019 14:13> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>chuckled at the ignorance, but he couldn&#39;t blame anyone. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Your government has lied to you,&#34;</font> he said, in pain and in grace, he rose his hand to the cosmos and made a fist. Blossoms did release from trees, like blood from the veins. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Schwarzmantel of the Weiﬂmantel. I do not belong in any domain, even though the emperor constructed them,&#34;</font> the messenger said.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;My duty as the blackcloak is simple, freund. I simply deliver the truth and sacrifice all that is necessary. I, a mere orphan, was accepted and taught as if family. That is the least I could do.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:20> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>placed his face back onto his hands and let out a whistling noise, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;So basically....You&#39;re like a a remainant soldier from this organization named Welmantel and my government-well the current government has tracked you all down and is trying to demolish any information about you guys and your deeds?&#34;</font>He stated as a recap to what he was saying.

The reason he did so, was to help him process it all.It wasnt as though what he was saying was complicated or shocking, but it just didn&#39;t make sense to him.Why would the government want to discredit those that helped stop a war? 

Although that was a valid question, Zoku, wasn&#39;t the type to address something unless he felt absolutely necessary.So he decided to just nod and watch the unknown shinobi&#39;s mannerism...This guy was just too suspicious!<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/12/2019 14:23> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>still stood there, on the bench, placing his book in his pouch. He rised up off of the bench, Kato placed his hand on his chin. Absorbing all of the information that this &#39;shinobi&#39; was giving him, he had some questions for the shinobi.

<font color=#666699>&#34;So. . What did the &#39;government&#39; lie about?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:24> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0x0]><font color=#d4586b>Sound Ninja says, "WTF IS THIS BUG"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:31> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>stepped forth as the mantle danced upon the breeze. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Silence, that is the sound of your government,&#34;</font> he said as he pointed at the soldiers. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Isan delivered the end to his opponents, but for some odd reason, the sons and daughters of these leaders began to lead once more. The council hid information, solely to besmirch the emperor once more.&#34;</font>

A sigh rose from one&#39;s lips, <font color=#ffffff>&#34;there is soon to be a conflict once more. Weiﬂmantel sent me to find those responsible, to spread the message and to inform as many as possible. Weiﬂmantel was formed as an order to stop innocent bloodshed, but this road once more leads to just that.&#34;</font>

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;A third world war where many sacrifices will have to be made..&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:39> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>was taken aback as watched the unknown shinobi.The way the man was speaking was if his organization was going to cause a third war? Zoku grimaced, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;I can understand-no I cant understand what your organizations has been through, but from what you&#39;re saying.....It sounds like you guys want a war? I aint down with that.&#34;</font>He announced.

<font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Im not for the government or against it...I am a shinobi, so i just follow orders, but id never be for something that wants war...ever,so I hope you aren&#39;t trying to  do this...&#34;</font>Zoku would then pull out a kunai.

What was this rookie shino<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:39> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>//what was this rookie shinobi going to do with it?<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:41> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>lowers his eyelid, as he motions towards the back of his hit, and placed his hand on top of his Kunai holster just encase the worse case situation were to happen.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;The past is the past. All we can do is to look at what our previous mistakes have done to the Shinodi world without dwelling on it, for that wouldn&#39;t help us in todat&#39;s present.&#34;</font>, Asahi began to say.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;There is bound to be conflict once more, but unlike what happened in the war years ago I will ensure that the Sound be prepared for it, so no sacrifices are casualties are to happen. I don&#39;t know if what you&#39;re saying about the Government is true or not, nor do i have the means to verify it. However, if that&#39;s what it takes to bring about a longer time of peace, then I wouldn&#39;t mind those who they govern to remain ignorant to the truth.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:46> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>would listen in as he propped his foot up on the wall.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:51> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>grinned in delight &#39;fore he held open his hand. Then, a hundred spiders began to climb from the gap of the grin. Each spider had a name, each an individual, prepared to give in their flame for the truth. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;We do not desire bloodshed, ,&#34;</font> the blackcloak stated &#39;fore he placed a finger underneath his eyelid.

Then, a crimson spider began to climb from the slit. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Shin,&#34;</font> he called the spider, once he looked on at the soldiers of the enemy domain. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;We were put here on this earth to feel nothing but pain,&#34;</font> he said to the spider.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;I&#39;ve seen many ignore the truth solely to protect their circle, but, the truth cannot be forgotten. The web we weaved in the past shall catch those flies that spread their lies. Do you know what spiders have in common with humans?&#34;</font> He questioned those before him.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;They devour each other.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:51> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#94ad8c>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>pulled out an apple and begins to peel the skin with the kunai, <font color=#94ad8c>&#34;Not that I can do anything about right now.&#34;</font>He said.The young Namikaze would then began to whistle as he dwindled away the foreskin of the apple.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 14:54> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>grew bored, this didn&#39;t interest him at all. Placing his hands in his pocket, he was going to train somewhere and do something productive. Sitting here and listening to this wasn&#39;t really something productive to him. Waving at the people that he knew, Kato began to walk off.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/12/2019 15:19> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#c161bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>was just eavesdropping on the dialogue, up until now. When he heard, that the strange man just challenged them to a battle in order to see if they are prepared for battle, he approached the group and stopped next to the bench.

The young genin really hated the word <font color=#c161bd>&#34;war&#34;</font>, since it took his entire family from him, and he really hoped that it&#39;s possible to avoid another one....Sadly it was highely unlikely, so the best move would be accepting the challenge, and finding out about his combat capabilities before it&#39;s too late.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:20> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc000492]><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja says, "Fighting huh?"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:20> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc000492]><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja says, "For what?"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:26> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>sighed in the most exaggerated manner possible. The spiders began to flood over the ground, as they seemed to talk to their father. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;We&#39;ve fought many times before in our previous lives. Araneus fought here, too. Toga did fight here, against the infamous usurper emperor; Tozuki Iwazuka..&#34;</font>

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;I, Kumojin, Adateus shall take their mantle of sacrifice. My intention is not bloodshed, but true peace under the return of the emperor. If you desire, you can join me and find out the truth for yourself, or you can keep being fooled by your government, used as livestock to keep their power afloat.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:28> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc000492]><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja says, "Either way, still gonna be fighting."</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:33> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#9966ff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>returned to their favorite spot in the village and watched a sermon from a man who has an audience of spiders as well as Otogakure natives. There was disinterest in their demeanor to the whole speech.

In fact, Stitch settles for reclining on the rooftop of the wall, awaiting for at least Kato&#39;s opinion on it.

<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:35> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>squints, as a horde of spiders were summoned forth from the Strange Man. he leaps back, and draws out a Kunai. Even though he was supposedly &#39;testing&#39; them, perhaps this may have been too much for a bunch of genin to fight off.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;I don&#39;t mind if the Government continues to deceive the people they have governed, for it has continuously brought us peace, and for once a time of prosperity. Engaging in conflict with the Emperor once more would only serve to reenact the past atrocities commited, for the Emperor himself was also willing to make sacrifices, no matter what it may have been. And look where that got him. For those reasons, I&#39;ll have to decline your offer, as much as a fool it would make me.&#34;</font>, the lad concluded, as he placed a firm grip on his Kunai.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;Those are just my feelings, however. I am unable to speak for anyone else.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:37> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc000492]><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja says, "aint we suppoed to scrap lol"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:37> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>looked at the spiders , they were growing in numbers. All he wanted to do is train, but he was stopped by these spiders and Shinobi. He didn&#39;t care for the speech or anything, it was pointless to him. He thought it was just a person trying to convince him for something stupid. Kato reached down to his kunai holster, thinking this can be some time of training for him.

<font color=#666699>&#34;Look, listen, I don&#39;t care for this.&#34;</font> His set his target on the spiders other then the Man who created them.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:48> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>observed the fools that desired to be fooled. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;Indeed, &#39;tis as history said,&#34;</font> the lord of arachnae spoke. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;There is no one interested in justice, justice is a long gone concept,&#34;</font> he announced. The spiders kept climbing from his mouth gap, until the entire street seemed to be covered in ivory constructs of silk.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;One side brings shadow, the other brings light. But in the rushing tide, every human is the same; a stain. They shall inevitably choose for disorder, instead of order. You and your friends are proof of this disorder, a desire to be deceived by those that have committed atrocities, murdered families, ended heroes, destroyed competitors,&#34;</font> the ivory man stated.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;Enough talking. Let us begin this trial, bastard humans, children of the usurper,&#34;</font> he declared &#39;fore his armor plate fell into the ground. The ivory cloak floated in the air as silk wrapped around the entire area, constructing a colosseum of woven webs. Then, he held up his singular arm, screaming into the aether.

The scream ruptured ear drums, as the pale skin of the teenage soldier turned crimson. Pupils turned silver, veins began to bulge.. and then he rushed to chop the throat of his opponents at once as if an executioner.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:57> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#71a6bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>narrowed his gaze upon the Strange Man and his spider companions. Seems like talking was no longer an option, as he was preparing to get things underway. Truthfully, when he said he wanted to &#39;test&#39; the group of genin, Asahi thought that fighting group of people, kids as they may be, would put them at a disadvantage, however, he immediately eliminated that and it were not the Sound ninja who should be weary.

<font color=#71a6bd>&#34;So be it.&#34;</font>, asahi said, as his eyes shifted into a Crimson hue, one tomoe visible within them. He looked around at the surrounding area, and at the Spiders. It seems each and every one of them were embedded with Chakra, so dealing with them as well as him would be tricky. None the less, Asahi braced himself for what was to come. He was determined to prove to him that the Sound was better off without the truth that he spoke of.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 15:58> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>Jumps back in response to the &#39; Ivory Mans &#39; assault, <font color=#198aad>&#34; You do realize.. Regardless of which path we take. War or fighting is inevitable, only thing that changes is the opponent. Either way, I can&#39;t just stand here and let this go on, nothin personal. &#34;</font> 

Shenza puts up the tiger handseal while he puts distance between himself and the spiders. Surely, nothing good was going to come of this. If things keep on going this way someone would get hurt. Kill or be killed huh?<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 16:01> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc000492]><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja says, "ooc please :C"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 16:01> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#666699>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>eye&#39;s became lighter, turning into a crimson color. The boy was confident in killing spiders, they were no different then a Deer or a wild animal in the forest, preparing himself for this &#39;battle&#39; this would be some training for him. With the grip tightened on the kunai, he moved his right hand with haste to collect some shruikens. With his hands now prepared for this.

His adrenaline rush kicked in. With his body tensing up, he was now ready to fight these spiders. Not knowing what this man had in his sleeves.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 16:01> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#c161bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>performs a quick warm-up exercise prior to the battle and assumes the combat dance stance of the Larch, preparing for it.

His first move would be an attempt to kill all the spiders in a single motion. Afterwards, he would join the rest in an attempt to defeat the stranger. The young Kaguya would utilize the Larch dance for the most part of the battle, but there&#39;s a chance that he would use the Camellia dance if the fight was too easy, or chakra scalpels if he was pushed to his limits. He wasn&#39;t exactly fond of fighting, so he would try his best to bring an end to the conflict as soon as possible.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

He&#39;d glance at the person who is on the ground then at the man whom had spiders under his command.

He&#39;d click his tongue, not really caring what happened. He just been waiting for a good fight. He&#39;d rise his hands up, untwisting his turban from off of his cranium. He&#39;d stuff it into his robe&#39;s interior pocket.

He&#39;d approach the fainted pale man on the ground, completely ignoring the long haired freak who glared at him.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

It was understandable to be angry about it and despite not showing it Hiroshima could feel it bubble under him as well. Believing in a cause that he was raised in but he was able to distinguish himself from his &#39;enemy&#39; in a way. <font color=#15665e>&#34;It is just like Cattle. They raised a wonderful life believing it to be prosperous but only set up for slaughter.&#34;</font> His analogy was brutal but that was they things were. <font color=#15665e>&#34;We&#39;re just the kind gentlemen with the knowledge and power to set them free.&#34;</font> He smirked.

He&#39;d drop forward taking his seat properly, <font color=#15665e>&#34;I mean you can hand a slave the key to their freedom but truly it is the mind that has to be free&#39;d first and then their decision of whether they will stay the course of that life.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 23:34> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>observed the wise teenage soldier as he nodded along, <font color=#ffffff>&#34;we are all different. But in the end, we were all born in this world, trapped in the same cage,&#34;</font> Adateus said. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;There is no fate, only the design of the one that began it all. We are players of his game and observe the world through its eyes. The phenomenon we call life, it might as well be nothing,&#34;</font> the soldier said as he observed his singular hand.

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;We must live life not to live, but to die knowing that we left a mark on life.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 23:39> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#15665e>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>had let those words sink in momentarily as he realized he was deeply rooted into the cause for the White Cloak and in the end they were his family in the way he watched after them and they watched after him. He didn&#39;t seem against these words but he never did utter once about him wanting to find out about his family and what had happened to them. That was a journey he was willing to walk on his own to find out. 

<font color=#15665e>&#34;I surely hope to gather much more information about this world before I go.&#34;</font> He said looking up at the ceiling momentarily. He hoped death&#39;s reach was far away from him at this point. <font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 23:45> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>placed his hand upon the shoulder of his friend. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;I&#39;m sure you shall,&#34;</font> he confirmed. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;You are after all special in your own way,&#34;</font> Adateus explained as he began to climb up from the seat. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;If you one day need support, you can always come to this family. This is your home, but not your original one; I understand that above anyone else.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 23:55> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#15665e>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>smiles as he thought of that as well. He had heard it so many times in the orphanage considering he was always the one to excel but mentally he never thought of himself as much. More or less he only thought of the other orphans safety first being one of the few older ones currently. It did explain why he had began taking his training much more seriously in comparison to the time of his studying.

<font color=#15665e>&#34;Not many do, but I&#39;m glad you understand.&#34;</font> He kept his identity under wrap when he traveled throughout the village and didn&#39;t refer to himself as Hiroshima, but Mugen instead. Why that name? It just belonged to a cool Kenjutsu user that he remembered hearing tales of as a kid. <font color=#15665e>&#34;What about you? What are you goals?&#34;</font> He asked out of curiosity. <font color=#15665e>&#34;I know you take the lead on a lot of our &#39;recruitment&#39; expeditions but I never really ask what really goes through your mind.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<big><07/13/2019 00:07> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>thought about the subject a lot. But, he couldn&#39;t simply respond. He closed his eyed and tapped his five fingers on the table. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;I desire... to see the light,&#34;</font> he said &#39;fore he opened his eyes. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;To see bustling streets filled of enriched peasants, to see the marching of soldiers come to an end, to see the leaders inspire and protect their citizens.&#34;</font>

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;..I desire to leave the world a little more fair after my flame disappears from this pyre,&#34;</font> he admitted.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/13/2019 00:11> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#15665e>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>chuckles lightly as he looks up at the young lady who walk over toward where he was sitting placing a cup with something to drink in it. It was tea, he was going to need a little energy to keep himself active. <font color=#15665e>&#34;A man of the people. I can respect that.&#34;</font> He nodded as he could hear the conviction in his voice. At most all he could think of people like Kato. 

<font color=#15665e>&#34;In that attempt, however, it could very well lead to yet another War.&#34;</font> He said as he took a sip from his cup and then placed it back down. He chose not to look at Adateus when he said such. <font color=#15665e>&#34;It could also mean more blood shed..are you truly ready for something like that?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/13/2019 00:13> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#ffffff>Kumojin, Adateus <font color=yellow>smiled at his friend, <font color=#ffffff>&#34;bloodshed is the only language that humans speak, that much has been proven in our history as this organisation,&#34;</font> he said. <font color=#ffffff>&#34;If we do not begin the conflict, another shall begin and wipe us out. It&#39;s simple, the first one to punch, is the one that shall be victorious..&#34;</font>

<font color=#ffffff>&#34;Why wouldn&#39;t the good guys be the one to win? Eventually.. they should... they need to.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/13/2019 00:18> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#15665e>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>did wonder where there any good or bad guys in all of this. War and pain also led to hatred and vengence in this world. This was going to soon become that much more of a problem for everyone. He was right though. Someone was going too throw the first punch and by all means he would protect his people at all cost. Hiro constantly made it clear his dislike for leadership roles to be placed on him, but never did decline the idea of actually taking on a position in the future. It was a lot of pressure and with as much baggage as he carried, he didn&#39;t want his obscure vision of life to ever jeopardize his family.

<font color=#15665e>&#34;A Bleak way of looking at it, but reality is reality. I just hope it is nothing that will carry on like the thirty year war...&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
