<big><07/11/2019 06:24> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc000559]><font color=#67b830>Kasuke, Azoran says, "Oh... HEY!"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 06:26> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#0066ff>Rain Ninja <font color=yellow>looked infront of her and saw someone she had never seen or met before calling to her.  She looked at him and turned her head to the side a bit wondering what they wanted.

<font color=#0066ff>&#34;Hello.&#34;</font>

It was a pretty bland response.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 06:27> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#67b830>Kasuke, Azoran <font color=yellow>would run up to the stranger and wrap his arm around her shoulder and as if to give her a side hug. He would look into her face with a big smile as his eyes creased into a squint. <font color=#67b830>&#34;Hey there! you wouldn&#39;t happen to know anything about  the sword shop here would you?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 06:31> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#0066ff>Rain Ninja <font color=yellow>looked at this person and tried to move a bit further away from them.  She wasn&#39;t comfortable being touched.

<font color=#0066ff>&#34;Don&#39;t touch.&#34;</font>

She looked toward a building she thought was the weapon shop and pointed a bit south toward it.

<font color=#0066ff>&#34;Swords there.&#34;</font>

She didn&#39;t mind this person being near them she just didn&#39;t want to be touched.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 06:39> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#67b830>Kasuke, Azoran <font color=yellow>Would let out a laugh, clearly not taking any offense to her request of being untouched. <font color=#67b830>&#34;Sorry about that!&#34;</font> Azoran would look towards the direction she had motioned, a look of confusion crept on his face despite his efforts to appear confident.
<font color=#67b830>&#34;You&#39;ll come take a look at the swords with me right?! It&#39;ll be really quick! You see I just saved up enough Ryo for a sword and it&#39;s my dream to be the greatest swordsman the world has ever seen!&#34;</font> Azoran would strike a pose spreading his legs far apart and using his right hand to point into the sky.
He would then mimic slashing through the air with a sword
<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 06:43> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#0066ff>Rain Ninja <font color=yellow>looked at this person blankly not understand why she would have to come with him to get a sword.  She assumed he did not have the intelligence to find it on his own and decided to help.

<font color=#0066ff>&#34;Come.  Swords this way.&#34;</font>

She began to immediately walk toward the sword shop.  She thought she knew where it was at the very least.  She motioned the person to follow her.

<font color=#0066ff>&#34;I will help.&#34;</font>

She continued to walk.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 06:53> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#67b830>Kasuke, Azoran <font color=yellow>eyes would light up upon entering the store. His eyes shifting all over the place clearly overwhelmed by the variety of weapons the shop owner had in stock. Ignoring the smaller lightweight swords a boy his size would more often be equipped with Azoran would instead walk over the middle sized swords, some of the swords being almost as tall as his adolescent body.
Azoran would pick up a broad sword with the blade appearing to be about 4 feet alone. after examining the blade for a short period he would swing the blade in a quick furry showing somewhat competence in his blade skills aswell as his upper body strength.
<font color=#67b830>&#34;Hmmm&#34;</font> The boy would scratch his chin before putting the weapon down and picking up a long katana of about the same size but clearly a bit more lightweight. Azoran would once again repeat his balance testing on the blade before flipping it around and strapping it on his back
<font color=#67b830>&#34;So What do you think of this one Heh?&#34;</font> He would look over at the girl with a smug look on his face
<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 06:56> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#0066ff>Rain Ninja <font color=yellow>looked blankly at the person and then blankly at the sword.  She had no interest in something like that.

<font color=#0066ff>&#34;Don&#39;t like swords.  Life is precious.&#34;</font>

She held to that phrase Life is Precious quite often.  It was the last thing her father had told her afterall.  Those words forever echoed in her mind and she took them very seriously to the degree that she even understood the words.  She wanted to exit the store because she had no interest in it.

<font color=#0066ff>&#34;I will leave.&#34;</font>

She tried to take a few steps toward the door assuming this person was helped.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 07:01> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#67b830>Kasuke, Azoran <font color=yellow>would turn towwards the girl and frantically unstrap the sword and toss it clumsily on a rack before jogging to catch up with girl.

<font color=#67b830>&#34;Hey! I didnt meant to offend you...&#34;</font>  A more serious look that he had previously shown appeared on his face as he looked off into the distance slightly. <font color=#67b830>&#34;You are absolutely right... Life is precious... Why dont we get out of here&#34;</font> 

Azoran would walk up close to the girl again going to reach his arm around her shoulders again before quickly correcting himself and shooting the arm down to his side. As he continued to walk with her out the exit
<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 07:05> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#0066ff>Rain Ninja <font color=yellow>was confused why this person kept following her.  She thought they needed help and they had helped them but they must still need help she assumed.  When she heard him say to leave she wondered if this person needed to find another building.

<font color=#0066ff>&#34;Still need help?&#34;</font>

She looked at him blankly hoping to understand what this person wanted exactly.  She didn&#39;t mind helping others as her interpretation of Life is precious was a little odd.

<font color=#0066ff>&#34;Outside?&#34;</font>

She looked toward the door and walked out the exit with this person.  She hoped to figure this all out eventually.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 07:10> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#67b830>Kasuke, Azoran <font color=yellow>Azoran would hold the door open for his new friend as they stepped out into the sunlight. Azoran would look around the outside as all signs of seriousness has faded from his face and his wide smile was back

<font color=#67b830>&#34;Thanks for showing the shop, By the way I dont think I&#39;ve properly introduced myself. My name is Azoran Kasuke!&#34;</font>
he would say before giving an exhaggerated bow. <font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 07:13> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#0066ff>Rain Ninja <font color=yellow>looked blankly at Azoran and nodded at hearing their name.  She still wasn&#39;t sure what else Azoran needed but she wanted to help for the sake of her father and his phrase.

<font color=#0066ff>&#34;Tameshi Haruno.&#34;</font>

She still just kept looking at him blankly.  She spoke in a pretty monotone way and seemed to be almost emotionless.  She was kind of odd.

<font color=#0066ff>&#34;You are welcome.  Still need help?&#34;</font>

She would likely help him as long as it took but she was trying to understand the goal of all of this and where else this person was trying to go.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 07:21> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#000066>Kasuke, Azoran <font color=yellow>would squint his eyes as he looked towards the sun, though not setting had became lower in the sky

<font color=#000066>&#34;Ah, Nice to meet you Tameshi! No more help needed. I think I should probably get going for now, but you&#39;ll have to tell me all about your hatred for swords another time, after all thats what friend do huh?&#34;</font> 

Azoran would look Tameshi in the eyes this time with a more genuine smile compared to before.  He extended his arm towards her slowly reaching for a friendly handshake<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 07:26> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#0066ff>Haruno, Tameshi <font color=yellow>looked at Azoran and nodded as she heard he no longer needed any more of her help.  She looked down and saw his hand coming toward her.  She had never had a handshake and had no idea what exactly he was doing besides trying to touch her again.

<font color=#0066ff>&#34;Don&#39;t touch.&#34;</font>

She did hear him say friend which she had none of yet.  She didn&#39;t interact with people directly but the word friend sort of resonated with Tameshi.  She pointed at him.

<font color=#0066ff>&#34;Friend.&#34;</font>

She felt an odd feeling of happyness not that she understood what she felt anyway.  But she put her hand back down.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 07:46> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#0000a1>Kasuke, Azoran <font color=yellow>would look at the strange girl before chuckling to himself a bit.

<font color=#0000a1>&#34;Yeah...friend..&#34;</font>

Azoran would give her a one last smile and a quick wave before jogging off into the distance.
<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 07:46> <i>Posted while alone.</i><br><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 21:58> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#0000a1>Kasuke, Azoran <font color=yellow>would walk towards the front gate of rain, carrying a large piece of parchment rolled up in his hand. The parchment had begun to yellow and tear at the edges giving it a worn look but for the most part had remained intact. He would set the parchment on the ground as he looked around crudely scribbed on it with some ink. A simple glance at the parchment became easy to tell it was a map drawn of the Rain village.

Azoran would then role up the parchment before placing it to his side. Just then he would noticed the unique looking girl that had been standing a short distance infront of him. He was not sure who she was but it was obvious she was irregular to say the least. Almost like a ghost. Azoran would give her a puzzled look before sitting up against the railing,
 intent on watching her.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 22:05> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#9966ff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>felt a pair of eyes watching them. The blood on Stitch&#39;s hands were removed, like they stopped halfway through to wash their hands. They slip their palms out the hoodie and slowly turned around.

<font color=#9966ff>&#34;I&#39;ll be a hypocrite. . .If I said its rude to stare. . .&#34;</font> Their purple orbs locked towards Azoran.
<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 22:12> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#0000a1>Kasuke, Azoran <font color=yellow>would get a look of embarassment on his face as he pushed himself up against the railings to stand up he would look off to the side breaking eye contact. her appearance made him uneasy to say the least.

<font color=#0000a1>&#34;Oh!... Sorry, I didnt mean to stare, that WAS rude of me. I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve seen you around here before. Are you from rain or just... passing through?&#34;</font>

Azoran would try to mask his discomfort with a smile as was his nature but had a hard time making his smile seem anything more than just out of sheer awkwardness
<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 22:16> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#9966ff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>did not avert their gaze. It was unflinching and wide-eyed now. Like a ghost staring at an intruder from the opposite end of the hallway. A haunting gaze to say the least.

<font color=#9966ff>&#34;I am just passing through.&#34;</font> They answered simply.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 22:26> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#0000b6>Kasuke, Azoran <font color=yellow> body language would change drastically. Oozing confidence unlike before and showing little fear towards the somewhat petite girl. He would place his hands on his hips 

<font color=#0000b6>&#34;Well dont be a stranger, welcome to Amegakure. The Land of the greatest swordsman and the most battle hardened shinobi!&#34;</font>

Azoran had no clue if shinobi were of an interest to the girl but the village&#39;s history of breeding some of the most ruthless shinobi to walk the earth had always been a great inspiration for himself; why shouldnt it be for everyone else? He&#39;d think to himself. 

<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 22:32> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#9966ff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>did not change their expression, it remained as bland and nonchalant as ever. Each village has something to brag about. Each individual one has something to their name.

Sound for their Uchiha and medics.

Rain for their ruthless swordsmen.

Leaf for their prodigies.

And Rock for their willpower and tenacity.

But the word &#39;Shinobi&#39; lost meaning. Its a word that is carelessly tossed around.

<font color=#9966ff>&#34;You are mistaking. . .The word. . .Shinobi. . .For Soldier. . .&#34;</font> Implying that the world in which they&#39;re now living in is no longer a world of Shinobi, but soldiers who flaunt the word without being able to perform how Shinobi performed.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 22:41> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#0000b6>Kasuke, Azoran <font color=yellow>would chuckle to himself. She was not wrong in general, the world had changed much in regard to the ways of the shinobi; however Azoran clung to the shinobi ideals and idolized the teachings of the shinobi.

<font color=#0000b6>&#34;You&#39;re wrong though. There are those in rain... No the world who still wish to follow the path of the Shinobi. They just need someone to lead them.&#34;</font>

His voice had an almost harsh tone to it but it was clear by his face that it was not intended to be offensive to her. he was just passionate about the subject at hand

<big><07/11/2019 22:43> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc0004fa]><font color=#9966ff>Rock Ninja says, "What is your definition of &#34;Shinobi&#34;?"</font></font><br></big>

However a Shinobi doesn&#39;t follow his path to look like a hero. You may see them as such but I refuse your idea of Shinobi."</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 22:53> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc0004fa]><font color=#9966ff>Rock Ninja says, "Oh my."</font></font><br></big>

<big><07/11/2019 22:54> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#9966ff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>chuckled out but just barely enough to prevent it from being all out laughter.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 22:54> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc0004fa]><font color=#9966ff>Rock Ninja says, "That is just delightful."</font></font><br></big>

<big><07/11/2019 23:02> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#9966ff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>reveals a sharp toothed grin, tilting their head to the side slightly. In a flash, with dust blowing behind them, an arm carefully wrapped around their shoulder as they leaned into his ear.

<font color=#9966ff>&#34;But you will never reach reality.&#34;</font> They whispered, freeing him of his grasp and returning to their original position.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

<font color=#0000b6>&#34;Yes, it was a pleasure to meet you. Maybe we will speak again one day and I can change your views on the shinobi&#34;</font>
<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

He sighed soon sitting himself down to enjoy his light meal but also taking notice of the other male in the area.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/13/2019 02:59> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#0000b6>Rain Ninja <font color=yellow>face would contort in a range of emotions as he stared at the plain white benches in front of him. The movement of the young man in front of him was able to catch his eye, bringing him back to the moment. It was then that he noticed the large blade swung on the strangers back. His eyes lit up with joy as he strolled over to the bench the young man was sitting at, all the while ogling at the blade as he walked over. 

<font color=#0000b6>&#34;That sword is..... BEAUTIFUL!&#34;</font> 

He would say as he got a few feet away from the stranger. He would smile down at the stranger with his vibrant friendly smile. his eyes would ease as he closed and become nothing more than small slits as his cheeks pushed up

<font color=#0000b6>&#34;D-do you mind?&#34;</font>

He would mutter as he motioned towards the sword clearly intent on inspecting it in his own hands
