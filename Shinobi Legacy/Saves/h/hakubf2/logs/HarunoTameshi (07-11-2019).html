<font color=#0000a1>&#34;Oh!... Sorry, I didnt mean to stare, that WAS rude of me. I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve seen you around here before. Are you from rain or just... passing through?&#34;</font>

Azoran would try to mask his discomfort with a smile as was his nature but had a hard time making his smile seem anything more than just out of sheer awkwardness

<big><07/11/2019 22:16> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#9966ff>Rock Ninja <font color=yellow>did not avert their gaze. It was unflinching and wide-eyed now. Like a ghost staring at an intruder from the opposite end of the hallway. A haunting gaze to say the least.

<font color=#9966ff>&#34;I am just passing through.&#34;</font> They answered simply.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 22:26> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#0000b6>Rain Ninja <font color=yellow> body language would change drastically. Oozing confidence unlike before and showing little fear towards the somewhat petite girl. He would place his hands on his hips 

<font color=#0000b6>&#34;Well dont be a stranger, welcome to Amegakure. The Land of the greatest swordsman and the most battle hardened shinobi!&#34;</font>

Azoran had no clue if shinobi were of an interest to the girl but the village&#39;s history of breeding some of the most ruthless shinobi to walk the earth had always been a great inspiration for himself; why shouldnt it be for everyone else? He&#39;d think to himself.

<font color=#0000b6>&#34;Yes, it was a pleasure to meet you. Maybe we will speak again one day and I can change your views on the shinobi&#34;</font>
