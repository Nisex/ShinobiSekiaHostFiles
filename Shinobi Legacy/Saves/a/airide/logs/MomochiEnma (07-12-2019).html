<font color=#9966ff>&#34;Would you like to fight me next?&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:32> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#a7c0b2>Momochi, Enma <font color=yellow>turned his gaze to the female before he shook his head before he stood himself up again.

<font color=#a7c0b2>&#34;I&#39;m still training.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 13:33> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#f07a2d>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>looks over towards her, raising an eyebrow at the massaging.

He was still training his taijustu, a lot more than his swordplay surprisingly, he scratched his head ever so briefly as he soon picked himself up after changing his bandages once again. He was getting a lot better at a few things, he was able to strike several times with his taijustu alone, he wanted to quickly master the taijustu style those in this small village before he started doing the other stuff. His village was known as bloody mist, he wanted to reclaim that title once again, one day. <font color=#a7c0b2>&#34;I want that blade..&#34;</font> he said as he took a breath as he continued his training for the time being.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>

He sighed soon sitting himself down to enjoy his light meal but also taking notice of the other male in the area.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/13/2019 02:59> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#0000b6>Rain Ninja <font color=yellow>face would contort in a range of emotions as he stared at the plain white benches in front of him. The movement of the young man in front of him was able to catch his eye, bringing him back to the moment. It was then that he noticed the large blade swung on the strangers back. His eyes lit up with joy as he strolled over to the bench the young man was sitting at, all the while ogling at the blade as he walked over. 

<font color=#0000b6>&#34;That sword is..... BEAUTIFUL!&#34;</font> 

He would say as he got a few feet away from the stranger. He would smile down at the stranger with his vibrant friendly smile. his eyes would ease as he closed and become nothing more than small slits as his cheeks pushed up

<font color=#0000b6>&#34;D-do you mind?&#34;</font>

He would mutter as he motioned towards the sword clearly intent on inspecting it in his own hands

<big><07/13/2019 07:15> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#a7c0b2>Momochi, Enma <font color=yellow>huffed a bit after he releases his hold on the tree to get a better angle at his work, almost everywhere in his perimeter were logs. Hanging from the sturdy branches he gave it a good whack with his weapon, soon the logs swung violently as they collided with one another causing chain reaction to occur as they bounced off one another to the point where two logs were coming towards Enma simultaneously. While he could sense it coming, he couldn&#39;t stop the attack from colliding with the back of his head while stopping one of the logs. In a daze, Enma held his head and crumbled a bit trying to regain some of his composure. The logs did hurt, so this was perfect training for him getting used to his weights, fighting multiple enemies and then some, or at least that&#39;s what he thought. 

Enma furrowed his brow a bit as he placed his hand on the ground as he slowly picked himself up after his last bout. He was making some more improvements as he felt his reaction time slowly acclimating to his weights as he was able to dodge some of the logs, but he was still getting hit or not reacting enough in order to block an incoming blow. <font color=#a7c0b2>&#34;Dammit.&#34;</font> he cursed as he held his back this time as he reached over to pick up his weapon. He wasn&#39;t making as much progress like he had originally envisioned bothered him greatly, the picture of the knight he had in mind was already being overshadowed by others who had already taken his place and while he was truly happy for them, he was the weakest link, or at least he felt like he was compared to the others. He knew he felt inferior to people of the Hoshigaki clan, and rightfully so as he held them on a higher plane of importance. It was truly unbecoming as a Knight, hell what would his parents say to him if they saw how deep in a rut the was over stuff like this? Would they berate him? Tell him that he&#39;s over thinking things? He honestly didn&#39;t know and that&#39;s what was bothering him the most. <font color=#a7c0b2>&#34;This is pathetic.&#34;</font> Enma said as he started to direct his anger towards the logs surrounding him as he wacked one as hard as he could sending it flying into another starting the chain reaction again. 

Enma steeled his mind as shifted his footing watching the logs coming towards him, firs the struck the log rather had before getting himself pushed back. <font color=#a7c0b2>&#34;Shit.&#34;</font> He didn&#39;t notice it but there was a second log behind the first adding more force towards the impact, he also had some coming from the side and luckily nothing was coming from the back. First, he dashed forward thinking he could tank the incoming blow by using his sheath to block most of the built-up impact causing him to stagger backwards. He didn&#39;t have much time to retaliate so he ducked under narrowly avoiding another strike.

<big><07/13/2019 07:18> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#a7c0b2>Momochi, Enma <font color=yellow>spat out some water as he slowly picked himself up after moving a and through his hair wiping off some of the water from clouding his vision. <font color=#a7c0b2>&#34;Not yet.&#34;</font> he told himself after finding more strength to contiue this rather violent form of training.

At some point it did dawn on the Rain Shinobi that yes, he was pushing himself way too hard to no avail, but he just didn&#39;t want to stop, something was telling him otherwise to continue going, and he did.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
