<big><07/11/2019 13:01> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#c161bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>enters the hospital and walks up to the vending machine. The kid inserts a few ryo into the machine and presses one of the buttons. Afterwards, he would pick up the drink he bought, sit on the nearest bench and proceed to drink in silence.The sound ninja has a headband attached to his ninja bag, so it&#39;s easy to tell where he came from.

<big><07/11/2019 13:07> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#329aa9>Momochi, Enma <font color=yellow>turned his gaze over to the Ninja in unfamiliar clothing. Now he didn&#39;t say anything at first as he was just calmly minding his own for the time being, and enjoying a lightl meal with a bottle of water. <font color=#329aa9>&#34;Your clothes are weird.&#34;</font> he finally spoke breaking the silence before drinking a bit of water.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 13:15> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#c161bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>turned around a few times, looking for the person the amegakure shinobi was talking to. When he finally realized no one is around, he spoke. <font color=#c161bd>&#34;M..me...? What is wrong with my attire? I don&#39;t understand...&#34;</font> The young ninja decided to inspect his clothes, but he couldn&#39;t figure out what&#39;s weird about them.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 13:26> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#329aa9>Momochi, Enma <font color=yellow>waited a bit to respond before he simply responded, later. <font color=#329aa9>&#34;Uhh I never said there was anything wrong with it.&#34;</font> he said bluntly before finally capping the bottle of water.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 13:37> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>The village that rested before him seemed to be clouded by fog. Tall buildings and bridges were hidden by the fog that surrounded it. Overtaken by curiousity the ninja ventures in, oblivious as to what he may find. A sign stood tall in front of him which read: Amegakure. He squinted his eyes as he made his way through the mist, walking slowly as his hair soon became damp due to the rain. As he went further into the village, he saw twin doors that seemed to have light creeping from under them. &lt; So it isn&#39;t empty... &gt; He slowly walked towards the doors.

Pushing them open as he poked his head through, there seemed to be two ninja sitting on the chairs of the building. One who he recognized slightly, only seeing him pass by in his home village. That put him at ease for a while as he walked inside. He gave a nod to both of the ninja as he continued to walk inside. <font color=#198aad>&#34; Am I interrupting something? &#34;</font> The aura of the room was moreso calm so he felt welcomed as he sat on one of the chairs in the room.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 13:53> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#c161bd>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>scratched his head, because the stranger said his clothes are weird, but now said that there&#39;s nothing wrong with them,
 
<font color=#c161bd>&#34;&lt;How were they weird then?&gt;&#34;</font> he thought. 

The kid decided to drop this topic, since he couldn&#39;t understand the other guy, and moved onto a new one.

<font color=#c161bd>&#34;So..this is a really nice village, but it&#39;s probably even more quiet than otogakure, so many buildings, yet it&#39;s silent-- Actually...that&#39;s a good thing, and any place is better than my village...because the hidden sound village reminds me of......nevermind.&#34;</font> 

The young shinobi would stand up and throw the bottle he emptied into a trash can. He would ignore the fellow otogakure ninja.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 13:59> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><IMG CLASS=icon SRC=[0xc000494]><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja says, "he&#39;s not afk.)_"</font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 14:06> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#329aa9>Momochi, Enma <font color=yellow>looked around the village after they commented on it. He didn&#39;t have that many fond memories of it. well he did, but tha&#39;ts neither here nor there it felt as he moved his hand over to unstrap the weeapon from his shoulders to pat his shoulders a bit after he set the large blade against his side. <font color=#329aa9>&#34;Ow..&#34;</font> He said as he massaged himself a few more times ebfore he eventually sighed.

<font color=#329aa9>&#34;It&#39;s..okay.&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 14:21> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#198aad>Sound Ninja <font color=yellow>Seeing as though he&#39;s been ignored he decides to relax and listen in. The conversation was rather odd as he couldn&#39;t really grab the main topic of it. Something about the village? <font color=#198aad>&#34; What happened to your shoulder? Or is it just sore from that huge sword on your back. &#34;</font> 

The ninja seemed to be able to lift it up easily, maybe strong in taijustu? The headband on the ninjas forehead suggested that he was of the rain village. After all, this was the rain village so that&#39;s to be expected. On the other hand, he did wonder why a ninja from his own village would be here. Could it be similar to his own reasoning?<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/11/2019 14:38> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#990033>Momochi, Enma <font color=yellow>shook his head briefly to the queston. <font color=#990033>&#34;I&#39;m used to to the weight of the sword, I have to be since it&#39;s my weapon of choice, the weight can be an issue, at times.&#34;</font> He nodded to himself a bit as he sighed patting his arm a bit. When he was thinking about it he didn&#39;t seem to have done anything to it? Maybe it&#39;s just from sleeping on ti wrong.

<font color=#990033>&#34;I think I&#39;ll be fine. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s form the weight...at least I hope not.&#34;</font> The pain seemed to be easing slightly, but it wasa still there, he just wanted to take a small break from having his weapon strapped to his shoulders for a bit. He still sighed a bit as he rubbed the  nape of his neck, there were two Ninjas from Otogakure it seemed. He did immidately assume something was going to happen, but, nothing of yet as occured, for now at least.<font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
<big><07/12/2019 08:26> <font face="Century Gothic, Arial"><font color=yellow>*</font><font color=#993366>Momochi, Enma <font color=yellow>tooks several breaths a she moved his hand on his blade as he started to think a bout a few things He took his head a bit as he started to leave to the village to the east, he wasa reminded about a few more things he could use as supplemenary justus.

<font color=#993366>&#34;Right..&#34;</font><font color=yellow>*</font></font></font></font><br></big>
